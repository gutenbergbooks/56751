</div>
<p class='c006'>“The Jolly Book of Boxcraft” has been enlarged
and rewritten from work started in May, 1909. This
work was purchased by <i>St. Nicholas</i>, <i>Little Folks</i>,
<i>Good Housekeeping</i>, <i>The Congregationalist and
Christian World</i>, <i>The Designer</i>, <i>Holland’s Magazine</i>,
<i>The Housekeeper</i>, <i>The Ladies’ Home Journal</i>,
<i>The New York Herald</i>, and <i>The New York Tribune</i>.
Thanks are due to them for the courtesy of
using material which was included in their articles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author feels that it is only right to acknowledge
her indebtedness to the children themselves who
have lent their toys and helped in many little ways of
their own toward the making of this book. Special
thanks are due to Elizabeth Hendricks, Raymon
Guthrie, Henry Jarrett, Stanley Hoyt, and Wesley
Meehan, playfellows.</p>

  <h2 id='BOXCRAFT' class='c005'>BOXCRAFT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make Boxcraft</b>: cardboard
boxes, paste, scissors, crayons or water-color
paints; perhaps a ruler, and pencil will help.</p>
<p class='c006'>Do you believe in fairies? I do. I know three of
them, and they are quite as wonderful as Cinderella’s
fairy godmother. She could make a coach and pair
out of nothing at all but a pumpkin and some mice,
but the fairies that I know can do even better than
<i>that</i>! They can make a whole toy shop full of toys
from nothing at all but some cardboard boxes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fairies that I know are called Happy Thought,
Nimblefingers, and Play. They have so much magic
that they can transform even dull days and make
them jolly ones. All three of them came to see me
one very rainy day, and each of them sat upon a cardboard
box while they all told me in chorus about the
fairy art of boxcraft.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you ever noticed how much an ordinary
shoe-box looks like a little building with a flat roof?”
Happy Thought inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All you have to do to make it a house,” Nimblefingers
put in, “is to cut doors and windows in its
sides.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then, when you have made the house, you
have all kinds of fun with it,” laughed Play.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boxes will make chimneys for your house,”
Happy Thought pursued. “Boxes will make furniture—beds,
tables, chairs, mantels, pianos, benches—everything!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You need only to cut the box rims to make them,”
Nimblefingers interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And when they are made—oh, <i>think</i> of the things
you can use them for!” chuckled Play.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A whole village can be made—cottages, school,
store, church, railway station, bridges, tunnels—everything,”
Happy Thought went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And <i>all</i> that you need to do it will be a pair of
scissors, a pencil, some paints, and maybe some paste.
I’ll show you how,” Nimblefingers volunteered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the village is made, all your toys can play
in it! Haven’t you some roly-poly tumble toys, and
some penny dolls, and toy animals?” Play demanded.
“I know you must have.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the village is not <i>all</i> that you can make from
nothing at all but some cardboard boxes. You may
make almost any kind of a toy: a theater for dolls, a
merry-go-round, an Indian wigwam, and games, and
games, and GAMES!”</p>

<p class='c007'>So, the fairies, Happy Thought, Nimblefingers,
and Play, told me how to make all these magic toys
from nothing at all but cardboard boxes, and they
asked me to tell the children about it, so that they
might know how to change dull days into bright and
happy ones when they had learned of the magic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cardboard boxes are to be found everywhere.
They are in your home and in everybody’s home.
Butchers, bakers, candlestick makers, milliners, druggists,
jewelers, stationers, grocers, drygoods firms,
shoe stores, book stores, toy stores, all keep them.
Everywhere, everywhere there are cardboard boxes—big
boxes, little boxes, middling-sized boxes; wide
boxes, narrow boxes, deep boxes, shallow boxes;
round boxes, oblong boxes, square boxes! Boxes,
boxes, BOXES everywhere! All you need to do is
to ask for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>People at home are throwing them away. The
butchers, the bakers, the candlestick makers, the
milliners, the druggists, the jewelers, the stationers,
the grocers, and the dry goods firms, as well as all
the others, are constantly sending boxes to your home.
The shoe stores, and the book stores, and the toy
stores, and ever so many others, are throwing boxes
away just because nobody seems to realize what
magic there lies in them for the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Happy Thought, Nimblefingers, and Play
first told me about boxcraft, I did not find any trouble
in securing the kind of box that I needed for the
toy-making. I found that the merchants were very
glad to give me boxes when I asked for them. They
smiled when I asked. They did not know that a toy
circus tent could be made from a round hat-box.
They did not know that a whole village might be
erected out of six shoe-boxes!</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the boxes given me were three very large
ones. One was deep and wide. It came from the
milliner’s. It was not a bandbox, but a box used to
pack hats away in. In it I kept all the boxes that
came to me. The small ones I packed inside the
large ones. It was a simple matter, after that, to find
what I needed when I wished to make a table, or a
chair, or a punch show, or a school-house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another box that was given me was wide and flat.
Into it I put all pretty papers that came my way—lace-paper,
pinwheel paper, sheets of waxed sandwich
paper and glacine book covers, crape paper,
spools, cotton, pencils. Everything that could lie
flat went into this wide, flat box, to be stored till
needed. This box packed into the first box easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third box was broad, and square, and deep.
Into it I packed the playthings I had made after I
had finished playing with them. It fitted into the
side of the first box above the wide and flat one. All
these could be put out of sight in my play-closet when
night came and it was time to pick up.</p>

<p class='c007'>These boxes I called my treasure boxes. I hope
you will find three like them and keep your boxcraft
materials as I kept mine, for Happy Thought,
Nimblefingers, and Play told me about the plan, and
I think it is a splendid one.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have some pretty samples of wall-paper,
you can easily cover your treasure boxes with them.
There <i>might</i> be some wall-paper like that in your
play-room. If so, this would be the very thing.
Then, the boxes may be placed anywhere you choose
in your room.</p>

<p class='c007'>These treasure boxes are not meant to hold large
toys. It is the little toys that you will like best to use
in boxcraft play. The toy figures and the animals
will pack into very small space. The corrugated
cardboard for roofs, the green crape paper for grass,
the pretty shells, pebbles, and artificial flowers for
garden building, take but small space.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tools for your boxcraft, scissors, and paste, and
paint-box, may go into the large, deep treasure box
too.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here in this book you will find the toys that the
fairies have shown me how to make. There are
many, many more. You can try the magic craft of
the fairies for yourself in your own way. If your
boxes are not always exactly like mine, make them
answer by adapting the general plan of the toy to the
box which you have. Learn to make much out of
little. That is the motto of boxcraft play. THAT
is what Cinderella’s fairy godmother did when she
changed a pumpkin into a golden coach. That is
what fairies <i>always</i> do! They find magic in <i>little
things</i>—so suppose you try it too!</p>

  <h2 id='COTTAGE' class='c005'>THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE OF BOXVILLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Little Cottage</b>:
one shoe-box with its cover, a twelve-inch square of
cardboard, three small boxes, and a bit of glacine
paper to make window-glass.</p>
<p class='c006'>Here is the little Cottage of Boxville. I think
<i>The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe</i> might better
have chosen to live in a shoe-box like this than to
have made her home in an old boot! The cottage
certainly seems cozy, and far more comfortable than
a shoe would be. I know that her children would
have preferred a dwelling like this. I am sure you
like it better yourself, so I am going to tell you how
you may build one just like it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Find a shoe-box and take its cover off. Set the box
upon its side with the bottom of the box facing you.
This is to be the front of the cottage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the front you will need to draw two windows
and a door. Take your ruler and a pencil. Measure
a window space two inches from either end of the
box. Make each window space two inches wide and
two inches high. Half-way between these, draw a
door space with its base at the base of the box. Make
the door space two inches wide and three inches and
a half tall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Down the center of each window space from top
to base of the square, draw a line which divides it
into half. This forms the window-blinds, which
you will need to cut open. (To make window with
blinds, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>B</i></a>, page 166.) Cut top line.
Cut down the center line and cut across the base of
the square. Fold the sections of cardboard outward
against the sides of your box, and you will have made
a window with blinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half-way between windows is the door space.
(To cut door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.) Cut
across the top line of your square, down one side and
across the base. Fold the cardboard outward, and
you will have made a door that you can open and
close at will.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you happen to have a round-headed paper-fastener
that has two pointed prongs that are meant
to press through papers to keep them together, take
it and press its prongs through the little door where
a door-knob should be. Bend the prongs together to
one side and you will have a door-latch. By turning
the round knob, you may fasten the door or open it,
as you like.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roof of the cottage is supported upon two pieces of cardboard
cut to fit each end of the box. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>A</i></a>, page 168.) To make these,
take your cardboard and cut a piece the width of one end of your
box and four inches higher. Make a second piece of cardboard like
it to fit the other end of your box. Glue both on the box, one on
each end. Then, with scissors, cut each piece off diagonally
downward from the top at the rear of the box to the front of the
box. This cuts off a corner and makes a sloping rest for each end
of the cottage. Upon these the cover of the shoe-box is slipped
to make half of a sloping roof.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>AA</i></a>, page 168, showing
box cover placed upon side-wall pieces.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Slip your box cover over the two points, when
both are thoroughly dry. See, it makes the best kind
of a roof for your cottage!</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to add a chimney, any long, narrow
box that is small enough to form the right proportion
to the roof may be used. Measure its base upon the
cottage roof near the top. Cut the cardboard of the
roof so that the box end may be slipped through it
and stand erect, and you have a chimney. If you
use a box which has a sliding cover like a drawer,
its outside will be like a real little chimney. You
may mark off bricks upon it with a pencil, and color
it bright red. A wad of cotton will form the smoke
for a chimney.</p>

<p class='c007'>I painted blinds and door of the cottage that you
see in the picture. Blinds were green and the door
was brown. You may use almost any kind of paint
to do this. The colors from your water-color painting-box
will answer. You may use crayons too, if
you like. Other paint takes somewhat longer to dry.
It is not so well adapted to the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>In front of my cottage, I made a garden with some
artificial flowers that had once been on my summer
hat in a wreath. You may easily make a garden for
your cottage, or you may have tubs of flowers like the
one in the picture. It is the lower half of a pill-box
filled with forget-me-nots.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cottage is furnished with furniture cut from
small boxes. These may be three inches long or
smaller. My furniture is all painted, but you need
not paint yours unless you care to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bed is made from a box and its cover. To
make it, first take the lower half of your box and turn
it over so that its rims are below instead of on top.
At each corner cut a leg for the bed, and remove cardboard
from between these cuttings, so that it leaves at
each corner of the rim a two-sided leg. (To cut bench
form, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>A</i></a>, page 175.) When you
have cut this lower half of the bed, take the cover
of your box and turn it so that its rims come upward
instead of downward. Remove the rims from each
long side, and you will have left the head and footboard
of the bed. Glue this piece to the lower half
you first cut, and the bed will be finished. Sheets
and pillow may be cut from tissue or lace-paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>A chair is made from the lower half of any small
box. Beginning at the center of one long rim of the
box, cut the rim off half-way around. The part with
rim removed will be the back of the chair. The other
will be the seat and legs. Legs are cut to right and
left of each forward corner. Cardboard is evenly
removed from between them. Rear legs are cut in
each rim at the side of the box in the same way,
except that these rear legs have but one cut needed.
They are not cornered as the front legs are. (For
cutting a chair, see <a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A table for the cottage is made from a spool by
standing the spool on end. Over its top is placed the
half of a small round box. (A square box cover may
answer quite as well.) The table may be made from
an ordinary spool, or two twist spools glued end to
end. (For table, see <a href='#diagram-06-4'>Diagram Six, <i>DD</i></a>, page 178.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A mantel with fireplace for the cottage may be cut
from a small box three inches high. Stand the box
on end and cut from its rear, near the base, an opening
like that of a fireplace. (For cutting a mantel with
fireplace, see <a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Six, <i>G</i></a>, page 180.) Use the
back of the box, as it has no printing upon it. If
your box is painted, it will not matter whether or not
you make your cutting in the front, as the print will
not show when cleverly painted over.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my cottage there lived a tumble toy lady. Her
name was Polly Ann. You can see her in the picture
with her china dog. You may use roly-poly tumble
toys or penny dolls to play with in the cottage.
Figures cut from magazine pictures are fun to use,
too. Color them with your paints or crayons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides tumble toys, Noah’s Ark figures, and picture
people cut from magazines, villagers for Boxville
cottages may be found at any penny store where
children trade. These are small dressed dolls, one
cent apiece!</p>

<p class='c007'>In candy shops where party favors are sold, all
manner of small figures may be bought. These are
odd little men or women—just the very ones to use in
playing Boxville plays. At every holiday season,
new ones appear! You can always find them.</p>

  <h2 id='STORE' class='c005'>THE BOXVILLE STORE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Boxville Store</b>:
one shoe-box with two shoe-box covers, two long
pencils, two spools, waxed paper, and small boxes.</p>
<p class='c006'>The village store of Boxville is made from a shoe-box.
One shoe-box cover makes the porch it rests
upon. Another forms the roof of the store.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to make a village store, also, place a
shoe-box upon its side, and then the bottom of the
box will become the front of your store.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will need to have a large shop window in
front. Make this first. Two inches from the right-hand
end of the box, mark with your pencil a wide
oblong space five inches by three. Cut out this
window space on all four sides. (For cutting a
window space, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a piece of waxed paper a little larger than
the size of your window. Paste this inside the box
building over the window space to make glass. Cut
strips of pinwheel paper and paste them around the
window on the outside of the box to make window-casings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now you are ready to make a door for your store.
Draw a door space on your box with your pencil.
Make it two inches from the left-hand end of the
box. Make it four inches high and two inches wide.
(To cut single door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.)
Cut across the top line, down the side line that is
next the window, and across the base. When you
bend the cardboard you have cut, you will have a
door that will open and close. Color the door, if
you like. It may be painted brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, you are ready to place the roof on your
store; but first, lay one of the box covers upon its rims
on your work-table and put the little store upon it,
well back, so there will be a porch in front. Then,
take your other shoe-box cover and fit it over the top
of the box building so that it projects over the porch
in front. Two long pencils, with ends run into the
openings of two spools, make pillars to place at either
corner of the porch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The step up to the porch is any small box you may
have.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside the store, a long hat-pin box makes a
counter. Flowers, leaves, pretty pebbles, shells, and
little toys such as you may find among your own playthings
may be displayed upon the counter.</p>

<p class='c007'>A roly-poly tumble toy will make a clerk for the
store, or, if you like, you may find both clerk and
customers in magazine pictures, and you can mount
them on thin cardboard and cut them out. There is
no end to the plays you can invent when your store
is finished. Polly Ann of shoe-box cottage, Boxville,
has just come to the store to buy a loaf of bread.
There it is—that pretty brown pebble! Those green
leaves are vegetables! The beads in that box are
apples! The shells are little cakes!</p>

      <div class='line'>And the penny’s made of paper, so, perhaps, I’ll make some more!</div>

  <h2 id='SCHOOL' class='c005'>THE DISTRICT SCHOOL OF BOXVILLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Building a Toy School</b>:
one shoe-box with its cover, a half-sheet of cardboard,
three small boxes about three inches long, the cover
of some narrow little box which has an inner drawer,
a pencil, a spool, and a box two inches long.</p>
<p class='c006'>Did you ever before see a toy school-house? I
don’t believe you have ever seen anything like Boxville
School, so I am going to tell you how you may
build one like it.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, you will need a shoe-box to form the house
itself. Its cover is the roof. To this, at either end
of the box, are glued two side walls which hold the
roof in place, slanting. The cover of some tiny narrow
box which is made with an inner drawer is the
chimney. Inside, the desks are made from the lower
parts of three boxes about three inches long. Their
three covers make the benches. A teacher’s desk may
be made from any small box you have. Its cover is
teacher’s chair. A spool forms the stove, and a pencil
is the stovepipe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Begin by taking the cover from your shoe-box.
Place the box upon the table before you so that it
stands upon one long side, with its bottom part facing
you, open at the back. The base of your box, which
now faces you, will be the part of the school which
will need to have windows made in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two windows must have blinds. The
window spaces must be located on the face of the
box, which fronts you. From these the blinds are
cut. Two inches from either end of your box, mark
upon the part which faces you two oblongs, each
three inches high and two inches wide. Mark a vertical
line down the center of each window space.
This forms the blinds, which you will need to cut.
(For cutting blinds, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>B</i></a>, page 166.)
Cut the top line, down the center line, and across
the base line. Press the two sections of cardboard
outward against the sides of the box building, and
you will have made the window with blinds. Color
these blinds, if you choose. Use crayons or water-color
paints.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, you will need to make the cardboard side
walls which support the box-cover roof. Take your
sheet of cardboard and measure with pencil outline
upon it the shape of one end of your box. Add to this
four inches at the top, and cut this piece from the
cardboard with its added height.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a second piece of cardboard identical with
the first. Glue each to one end of the box upright.
Cut from each the front upper corner point. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>A</i></a>, page 168, which shows the shape
of the side walls when cut.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a door in one of these side walls, near its central
part, where you see the door in the picture of
Boxville School. To make this, first take pencil and
ruler and make an oblong four inches high and two
inches wide. (To cut door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>,
page 167.) Cut top line, down one side line, and across
the base line. Fold the door outward. The cardboard
under the door in the side wall may be cut out
the shape of the door space. If you do this, your
door will bend open more easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you happen to have a round-headed paper-fastener,
press its pointed prongs through the little door
where a door-knob should go. The round head of
the paper-fastener will form a door-knob. Its prongs,
bent to one side, form the latch. It will catch the
door securely when the “door-knob” is turned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that the lower part of the school building is
finished, you may begin upon the roof. This is the
box cover. Place it upon the points of the side walls
so that it fits down upon them. You will readily see
how this is. (For placing a roof on a shoe-box building,
see <a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>AA</i></a>, page 168.)</p>

<p class='c007'>When the roof is placed, you will be able to judge
where the chimney-hole should be cut in the box-cover
roof. It should go near the top at the end of
the box that is opposite the door. The cover of
some narrow box which has a sliding inner drawer
will make the chimney. It will be just the right
shape, square and hollow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mark off upon the sides of this box the bricks of
the chimney. Color them red, if you like. If you
use a ruler, the work is easily and quickly done. You
do not need to mark the bricks unless you like. Your
box may be painted merely.</p>

<p class='c007'>To place it on the roof, you will need to cut out of
the school-house roof a piece of cardboard the size
of the end of your box. Decide where the chimney
should go. Mark the end of it with pencil upon the
roof at this point. Cut the cardboard out. (For
cutting hole for chimney in a box-cover roof, see
<a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>AA</i></a>, page 168.) Press the end
of the chimney
down through this hole. Press the chimney backward to make it
stand straight, and glue it. Some tiny bit of cotton stuffed into
the upper hole of the chimney box will form smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, you will be anxious to furnish your
school-house inside. You may make it like a real
district school such as you see in the country. It will
have desks, benches, a stove, and a blackboard—to
say nothing of a teacher’s desk and chair!</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower halves of the three small boxes form
desks. It is really a simple matter to make these.
They are the kind that have a shelf beneath the top.
They are open.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the lower half of one of these boxes. Place it upon one of
its long rims. The upper rim will be the top of the desk. The
ends of the box will need to be cut the shape of the sides of a
desk. (For cutting a desk out of a small oblong cardboard box,
see <a href='#diagram-06-5'>Diagram Six, <i>E</i></a>, page 179.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Fit a bit of box rim beneath the top of the desk
where the shelf should go, and glue its ends to the box
desk. The desk may be painted black, if you choose.
Make the two other desks like this one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The benches are next cut from the box covers.
To make a bench, make a cut with scissors in each
box rim at the center of each end of the box. Cut
each as far as the upper part of the cover. Half the
box will be the back of the bench. Half will be the
seat and legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, cut the legs. Then bend the other half of
the box upward, cut off the side piece at either end
of the box, bend the long rim upward. This will
make a bench with high back. (For cutting the legs
of bench and its high back, see <a href='#diagram-06-2'>Diagram Six, <i>B</i></a>, page
176.) In following diagrams, always cut where you
see the heavy black line. Bend where you see a
dotted line. The bench may be painted to match the
desks. Make other benches like the first one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher’s desk is made from the lower half of
another box—one about two inches long. It is made
like a table, except that no legs are cut in its end
rims. (For cutting a bench form for the teacher’s
desk, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>A</i></a>, page 175.) The desk may
be painted, if you like.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chair for this desk is cut from the cover of
the same box that made the desk. Cut the cover’s rim
half off the box, beginning at the center on one long
side. The part of the cover left without rim will be
the back of the chair. Cut legs at the corners of the
other half of the cover and at each side on the rim.
Remove the surplus cardboard from between them.
(To cut chair, see <a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177.) Color
the chair to match desks and benches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your school is <i>almost</i> done. The stove will need
to be put up—I’m quite sure that you never heard of
a district school-house <i>without</i> a stove! It is as much
a part of a district school as the dipper and the waterpail
used to be. The stove of this toy school is just
a spool painted black. Place it under the chimney,
with the point of a long pencil run into its upper hole
to represent a stovepipe. There! That is easy to
do, I am sure!</p>

<p class='c007'>The blackboard is a piece of black pinwheel paper
cut oblong and pasted between the windows. If you
have some old time-table in your home, perhaps you
will find in it a small map that may be cut out and
pasted to the walls of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can make text-books by folding pieces of
paper together. These can be placed inside the desks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Penny dolls make excellent scholars. A tumble
toy figure may make a schoolmistress or a schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the picture of Boxville School, you can see three
penny dolls and my tumble toy schoolmistress. The
dolls are at recess. Violet is trying to do a sum at the
board. Pansy is pretending to be “teacher.” Lily
has just finished her luncheon.</p>

<p class='c007'>When does your school open? Now! The scholars
will have to hurry or they’ll be late!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='CHURCH' class='c005'>THE LITTLE CHURCH OF BOXVILLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Boxville
Church</b>: one shoe-box with its cover, one narrow
box about six or seven inches long, one oblong box
cover three or four inches long, three small box
covers of about the same size (three inches), a
twelve-inch square of cardboard, and some colored
tissue-paper, with a spool.</p>
<p class='c006'>Ding! Ding! Can you hear the bell in the steeple
of the Boxville Church ringing? It does not ring
very loud, because it is such a small bell, but it <i>does</i>
ring beautifully! You can try it yourself. Suppose
that you make a little church like this for your
village!</p>

<p class='c007'>Take a shoe-box. Remove its cover. Lay the shoe-box
upon one long side rim. The bottom of the box
will become the side of the church. It will need to
have three long windows cut in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Draw these window spaces long and narrow, about
one inch wide and three inches high. Cut the two
end windows equally distant from the ends of the
box, and draw the outline of the center window mid-way
between these two. Cut the cardboard at the
top of the window spaces to a point. (For cutting
windows, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.)</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have some colored tissue-paper, you may
cut three pieces the same shape as the window spaces
you have cut out. Let them be a little wider and
longer, however. Paste each inside the box right over
the open window spaces. This will make stained-glass
windows. You can paint the window-casings
with black ink, or paint on the outside of the box
around the windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you prefer, you can make the window-casings
by pasting narrow strips of pinwheel paper around
the windows, instead of using the paint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boxville Church, as you can see, has a sloping
roof. This roof is the cover of the shoe-box supported
on two side walls, which are made of cardboard and
glued to each end of the box. You will need to cut
these side walls. (See <a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>A</i></a>, page 168.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Measure the exact width and height of your box
on the twelve-inch square of cardboard. Measure
one end only, and place the end of the box so that it
comes at the edge of your cardboard. At the top, add
four inches to the height, and cut out this oblong piece
you have drawn. Make another like it. Next, cut off
the two front upper corners diagonally down to the
mark you first made, showing the height of your box
building at the front of your box.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a church door in one of these sides. Make it
rather high—about the height of the church windows.
Let the base of the door come at the lower edge of the
side wall. Cut up through the cardboard vertically
for about three inches. Then cut the arch of the door
and bend as if it were on a hinge. (See
<a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167, for cutting door.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Paste each side wall in place on the box building
so that the points of each come at the rear of the box.
When the side walls are firmly dry, cut out the cardboard
that is under the door space of the side wall.
The roof is not quite ready to go on yet, however. You
will first need to arrange for the steeple or bell-tower.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the cover of your shoe-box and also the oblong
box you intend to use for a steeple. This may be either
a long candy box, such as chocolate peppermints
are often sold in drug stores, or it may be a box
such as jewelers use for hat-pins. The tower of the
church should come over the door. Near the top
corner of the shoe-box cover which is to be the roof
of the church, mark off the shape of one end of the
oblong box which is to be the tower. Cut out this
square from the shoe-box roof, and cut out about a
quarter of an inch more at the bottom, otherwise your
steeple will not stand exactly straight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, slip the roof over the points of the side walls.
See! that is it! And, next, slip the tower in place
down through the opening which comes in the roof
over the door. (See <a href='#diagram-03-1'>Diagram Three, <i>AA</i></a>, page 168.)</p>

<p class='c007'>If your tower is to have a bell, you can buy a bell
at almost any toy store. It will probably cost you a
penny. You will need to cut openings in the upper
part of the bell-tower box. Cut one on each side, as
you see it in the picture of my Boxville Church. The
belfry windows will be cut like ordinary square windows,
except for a point at the top. (For cutting
plain windows, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The bell is next tied like a locket to a double cord
or bit of string. One end of this string is used to
fasten the bell to the top of the tower. It is sewed,
with the help of a large darning-needle, to the cardboard
top of the belfry. The other end of the cord
will be the bell-rope, and this goes down through the
cardboard at the base of your tower box and through
the cardboard at the top of the shoe-box building. It
can be threaded to the darning-needle and pressed
through the holes made by the needle till its end hangs
down into the church vestibule, as you see it in the
picture. When you let the sexton pull this bell-rope,
ding, ding goes the bell, and the noise that it makes
is just the right size for a Boxville Church!</p>

<p class='c007'>Now you are ready to furnish the inside of your
church. Begin with the platform for the pulpit. This
is the box cover you have—the one about three or
four inches long. Place it where the platform should
go, opposite the door. The spool will be the pulpit.
Paste a little round cardboard disk over the opening
at one end of the spool, and this will be the top of the
pulpit. Paint the spool black.</p>

<p class='c007'>Use a long, narrow box cover for the pulpit chair.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177.) Cut the rim from
box cover, beginning near the center on one long side.
Cut till you have reached the point opposite. The
part of the cover from which the rim has been removed
will be the back of the chair. Bend it forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other half of the cover will be the seat of the
chair. Legs are cut in the front rim and in the side
rims that remain. To make front legs, keep the corners
of the box, and cut up to the part which is the
seat, the upper part of the cover. Remove the cardboard
from between these two cuttings. Then, make
the back legs of the chair in the box rims at side.
Place the little chair back of the pulpit, and color it,
if you wish, to match.</p>

<p class='c007'>At least three pews will be needed for the church.
They are to be made from the three small box covers.
(See <a href='#diagram-06-2'>Diagram Six, <i>B</i></a>, page 176, for making high-backed
benches.)</p>

<p class='c007'>With a pencil or pin-point, mark the center of each
short rim on these box covers. Then, taking one
cover, cut through the rim at the two points till you
have reached the top of the cover. Half of the
division made will be for the back of the bench and
half for the seat and the legs. Cut the legs in one half
as you cut the legs for the pulpit chair. Remove
from the other half of the cover the remaining end
rim. Bend the rim that is left at the top upward, to
make the high back of the bench, and color the bench
to match the pulpit and chair.</p>

  <h2 id='RAILWAY' class='c005'>THE BOXVILLE RAILWAY STATION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Boxville Railway
Station</b>: one shoe-box and four shoe-box covers,
one small box about four inches square and without
a cover, the shallow covers of two small boxes
three inches long, two long pencils, and a small square
of waxed paper.</p>
<p class='c006'>Boxville’s Railway Station is a real railway station.
It is not a tin thing such as you buy ready-made in a
toy shop. Boxville Station has a waiting-room with
a real ticket booth and benches. You can make just
the same kind of little station as you see in this picture.
It is easy to make.</p>

<p class='c007'>The building itself, you see, is the lower half of a
shoe-box placed upon its side. The platform is made
of two shoe-box covers placed end to end upon the
floor, and the roof of the station is one shoe-box cover.
The other shoe-box cover is the roof of the platform,
and this is supported by two long lead-pencils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you want to make a Boxville Station? To
begin, you must make two doors and a window on
the part of your box that is the front of the station.</p>

<p class='c007'>About an inch and a half from either end of your
box, mark a door space four inches high and two
inches wide. Use a pencil and ruler for the work,
so that it will be even. Half-way between the door
spaces you have drawn, mark off an oblong window
space two inches high and three inches wide. Now,
you can take your scissors and cut the doors in the
box. (To cut doors, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page
167.) Cut the top line of each door space. Cut the
bottom line also. The doors must open toward each
other, so cut each door space down the side next to the
window space. Push each little door inward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, cut out the window space. Cut it around
on all four sides, and keep to the line you have drawn
with pencil. (To cut window, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>,
page 166.) When you have finished this, take a piece
of the waxed paper you have and paste it inside the
station building over the window space to make window-glass.
The waxed paper should be cut a bit
longer and wider than the opening of the window.
You can measure it by the cardboard piece you cut
from the box.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish, you may color the doors of your
station building green or brown. Use whatever colors
you have, but if you use your water-colors, keep the
work as dry as you can. If you do not, the doors will
not be straight. They will curl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Place two shoe-box covers end to end upon the floor
or table, for you can put the building upon them now.
See, it is placed far back, so that there will be a platform
in front. Place the building at the left of the
platform made of the shoe-box covers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third shoe-box cover is the roof of the station
building, and you must fit it down over the station.
If you wish to have a roof over your station platform,
you will need the fourth shoe-box cover to make this.
To secure it in place, just cut two end corners on
the box rim as far as the top of the cover. Then,
turn this end rim upward and slip it under the right-hand
rim of the cover which forms the roof of the
station building itself. You will need two pillars at
the right-hand end of your platform to keep the long
roof up. These pillars are long lead-pencils. Press
the point of a pencil down through each right-hand
top corner of the long station platform’s top, and
secure the points below by running them into standards
made of spools. The pencil point will be firm
when run into the upper hole of a standing spool, and
when both pillars are so fixed, the roof will be quite
firm. (See <a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Three,  <i>G</i></a>, page 172.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, make a signboard for your station, and glue
it to the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will need to have a bench or two and a ticket
office in your station building. A little doll can be
placed in the ticket office. If you look at the picture
of my Boxville Station, you will see a lady buying
her ticket of the ticket agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ticket booth is the lower half of a box that is
about four inches wide and an inch or so deep. You
will need to stand it on its rim and cut a window in
the part of the box that is the front of the ticket office.
You do this just as you cut the window for your
station, only you must make the ticket-booth window
smaller. Draw the outline of the window first with
help of pencil and ruler. Then cut it out. To cut
window, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.) When
window is cut, paste some waxed paper over the window
opening on the inside of the box. Cut a round
opening in this, near the bottom. The ticket agent
will need this, you see. Now, the ticket booth is
finished! Place it between the doors where it should
go.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will need a bench at either end of the station
waiting-room. Cut these from covers of two boxes
three inches long. (For cutting benches, see
<a href='#diagram-06-2'>Diagram Three, <i>AA</i></a>, page 176.) With pencil
or pin-point mark
a dot at the center of each short end rim of the covers, and cut
through each rim thus marked till you have reached the top of the
cover. Half of each division so made will be the high back of the
bench. Half will form the seat and legs. Cut legs in the rim of
one end. Leave the corners at the front of the bench and remove
the cardboard that is between them, making your cutting to the
right and left of each front corner. Then cut the rear legs in
both side rims. Bend the other half of each box upward. This is
to be the high back. Cut off the little pieces of cardboard that
are left on the narrow end rims. Bend what is left of the cover’s
rim upward to make the rest of the high back for each bench.
Color the benches black or brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toot-too! Don’t you hear the whistle of the toy
train? The baggage, that is made up of boxes, is
waiting on the station platform, and the little dolls
are ready to start on their travels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Doll is waiting on the station platform. She
has just purchased her return ticket to Boxtown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boxtown is the next stop. Everybody goes there
on Circus Day—Mr. Doll, Mr. Mulligan, Mr.
Swartzenheimer, Polly Ann, Susan Smith, <i>all</i> the

  <h2 id='FREIGHT' class='c005'>B. R. R. FREIGHT STATION AND SHOE-BOX TUNNEL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Boxville Freight
Station</b>: one shoe-box cover, one shallow cover of
a box about eight or nine inches long and seven or
eight inches wide, and the lower half of a deep box
about six inches long and four or five inches wide.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Dark Tunnel for
B. V. R. R.</b>: the lower half of an ordinary shoe-box.</p>
<p class='c006'>After you have built your Boxville Railway Station,
I am sure you will like to build a Freight Station
for your railway system. You will have so much
freight to go from Boxville! There is no end to the
little boxes! It will take you about five minutes, or
less, to build the freight station. It is so simple that
you can almost see how from looking at the picture.
The shoe-box cover is the platform. The lower half
of the deep box you have is turned upside-down and
placed upon the left end of the shoe-box cover. A
double door is outlined with pencil at one end of this
box. (See <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two</a>, <i>B</i>, page 167, for double
door.) Mark a square three inches wide on the end
of the box where the door should come. Draw down
the center of this from top line to lower line. This
gives the two divisions of the door. Cut the top line
of the door space. Cut down the center line of it and
across the lower line. Bend the two doors of the
doorway outward. Color them, if you like.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the square flat roof, take the box cover
and place it down over the freight building at the
top. That is an easy way to make a roof, isn’t it?
And now that the freight office is made, I am sure
you will agree that it is a very fine one indeed. Isn’t
it fun to build your own?</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you want to have me tell you how to make a
tunnel too? It will be fine to have one for your railway
system. To make one you will need a box—almost
any that is deep, like a shoe-box, will answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>How high is the smoke-stack of your train? Two
inches? Well, how high is it from the ground? Five?
Then, the holes made for the tunnel opening in either
end of the box will need to be higher still by an inch
or a half-inch. (For cutting a tunnel, see
<a href='#diagram-04'>Diagram Four, <i>B</i></a>, page 173.) Turn your box
over. The lower half is the only part you will need to use, so
put aside the cover. In either end of the box cut out a round
opening large enough for your toy train to pass through at a
sixty-miles-a-minute rate. There is your tunnel!</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have any crape paper, you can cover the
sides and top of your box so that it will look like a
big square hill. The ends of the box should be painted
with black paint to look like stone masonry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let’s see how well your train goes through the
tunnel—toot-too! Here it goes! Isn’t that the nicest
toy you ever saw?</p>

  <h2 id='HOTEL' class='c005'>HOTEL BANDBOX AND HOW TO FURNISH IT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Hotel Bandbox</b>:
one large bandbox with its cover, the cover of another
square bandbox that is larger. These make the building
and its roof. A shallow box cover will make the
roof over the front door. Two long pencils are
pillars. The hotel is furnished with furniture cut
from small boxes. Spools, lace-paper, pinwheel paper,
bits of wall-paper, and the glacine paper covers from
books may all be used.</p>
<p class='c006'>Did you ever before hear of a dolls’ hotel? If you
look at the picture of Hotel Bandbox, you will see
one that may be made from a square hat-box. Its
porch is a large hat-box cover. The building is a
hat-box, smaller than this cover. The roof of the
hotel is the cover of the hat-box itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Windows and front door are cut in the rims of the
bandbox.</p>

<p class='c007'>In starting to make a hotel, begin by marking off
windows. Each window must be two inches wide
and three inches high. It will help you to place
windows evenly if you mark a horizontal line around
three sides of your bandbox about three inches from
the top of the box. Use a ruler, and make all marks
as light as possible. They are only intended to guide
you, and must be rubbed out after you have cut out
the window spaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below the line you have drawn, make another,
three inches farther down the sides of the box. This
line forms the base of windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, make the windows that come nearest each
corner of the box. Measure two inches from each
corner. This gives the right spacing from the corner.
Measure two inches more on your horizontal line at
the top of the building, and this will give the width
of a window. Make the end windows first. Then
make the ones that come between. Space evenly, so
that windows may come at regular intervals. Cut
out each window on all four sides. (For cutting a
window, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.) Arrange
your lower story windows as you have the upper ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the center upon the front of your building outline
a large double door four inches square. It should
come at the very base of bandbox. (To cut double
door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>B</i></a>, page 167.) Cut its top
line. Cut its base line. Cut the cardboard between
these two lines in half vertically to make the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>When windows and door are made, then you may
paste some three-inch squares of glacine paper back
of each window inside the box. The window-glass
is made this way. If you like, you may leave some
windows open.</p>

<p class='c007'>The building is ready, now, to stand upon the
larger bandbox cover. As you see, this makes a porch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Place the smaller bandbox cover over the upper
part of your hat-box to make a flat roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Over the front door you may make a flat roof. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Three, <i>G</i></a>, page 172.) Use for it a narrow
box cover. Glue one long rim of this cover to the
cardboard over your doorway. Press a pencil point
downward through each forward corner of the cover
to make a pillar. The pencil points may be secured
in the holes of two spools and thus keep the roof
upright. If you wish, you may glue the spools where
they should go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a narrow strip of cardboard and write the
name of your hotel upon it. Glue this over the doorway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flower-stands for the hotel veranda are simple
things to make. One spool will be needed for each
flower-stand. Press the stems of some artificial flowers
into the hole of the spool. If you have gilt paint, you
can gild the stands. I painted mine with black water-color
paint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Penny dolls make guests for the hotel. They come
already dressed, but you can take one or two of yours
and dress them like men dolls. I inked mine. You
can see them in the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>How are you going to play <i>inside</i> the hotel? If
you look at the second picture of the hotel, you will
see that it is the back of the box, and that each corner
at the back of the box has been cut. When this is
done, the back lets down. You can cut your hotel
building this way. As you see, it may be closed up
again, when you are not playing inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Partitions for downstairs rooms are made with two
shoe-boxes—just their lower half is used. Cut the
ends off each box. Place each lengthwise inside the
hotel so that there is a space between them. This
space forms the hotel hallway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a piece of cardboard to fit into your box and
put it over the top of these two shoe-boxes. It forms
the floor for the second-story rooms. Another shoe-box—or
two, if you prefer—makes partitions for
second-story rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doors may be cut in these partitions. (For cutting
a single door space, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Samples of wall-paper make good carpet for the
hotel. You may cut it into squares to make rugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Window curtains may be made from tissue-paper
or lace-paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The furniture, itself, is cut from very small boxes.
Tables are made with spools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower half of a small oblong box may be cut
to form a chair by removing its rim, half-way around—beginning
to cut the rim at the center of one long
side of the box. The part from which the rim is removed
is the back of the chair. Press its cardboard
upward. The part that has the rim left upon it is the
seat of the chair, and legs are cut at its two front
corners and in each side at the rear. (See <a href='#diagram-06-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177, for making a chair.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Place a pill-box over an upright spool to make a
table. Round pill-boxes make round tables. Square
boxes make square tables. (See <a href='#diagram-06-4'>Diagram Six, <i>DD</i></a>,
page 178.)</p>

<p class='c007'>An oblong pill-box rested on its side will form a
doll’s bureau. Mark off the drawers upon its front,
and glue a strip of cardboard, upright, at its rear.
Paint a mirror frame on the strip of cardboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beds for the hotel chambers may be made of small
oblong boxes and their covers. To make the upper
part of the bed, cut off the long rims on each side of
the cover. This leaves headboard and footboard to
be glued to the lower half of the box when this has
been turned over to rest upon its rims. At each corner
of the lower half of the box, cut a leg for the bed
to stand upon. Remove the cardboard from between
each. (To cut bed, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>AA</i></a>, page 175.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Little dolls touring through Hat-box County stop
at the hotel overnight. Drummer dolls, on their
business trips to Boxville General Store, find comfortable
accommodations at Bandbox Hotel too. As
soon as the toy train stops at Boxville Station, you may
see them making a bee-line for the hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are splendid accommodations at Hotel
Bandbox. The meals are always good. You only
need to pretend what the dolls want and then give it
to them. Some want their steak well done and are
<i>very</i> particular about it, but the waiter <i>always</i> does
right and everybody is <i>always</i> satisfied. After dinner
the guests take a walk over to Mirror Lake and watch
the man who is fishing on the bridge there. Or else,
perhaps, they sit on the hotel piazza and watch the
people come to the Village square to get water at the
town pump.</p>

  <h2 id='APARTMENT' class='c005'>THE SHOE-BOX APARTMENT HOUSE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Shoe-box Apartment
House</b>: one shoe-box with the whole of its
cover, one small box about two inches long, and small
boxes and spools for furnishing the apartment house.</p>
<p class='c006'>You may make a whole row of apartment houses.
They are shoe-boxes that are placed to stand on end.
Windows are drawn upon the fronts of the boxes as
they stand. Each apartment house must have a porch
and front door as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would you like to erect an apartment house? Find
a shoe-box, then.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take its cover off. Stand your box on end with
the opening at back. Let the bottom of the box face
you. Mark off upon it three window spaces, each
With its base five inches from the top of your box.
See that end windows are equally distant from the
sides of your box. Make each window two inches
high and one inch wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrange second-story windows evenly between top
and base of your box, and place below them the first-story
window. Leave a place for a door just above
the base of your box at the left, as the picture of Shoe-box
Apartment will show you. Make the door a
little larger than your window spaces—about three
inches high and two inches wide. Next to it, draw a
Window space for the first-floor window.</p>

<p class='c007'>The windows may be cut out, if you like. (For
windows, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.) Cut out
the squares you have drawn on top, side lines, and
base. Back of each window opening, paste a bit of
waxed sandwich paper to form glass. Outline on
the front of the box around the windows, the window-sashes.
Use black ink or water-color paints to do
this work. Paste tissue- or lace-paper curtains over
the waxed paper inside the apartment house to make
the windows trim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut the door of the apartment house out. (For
door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.) Cut the top
line, down the side next to the window, and across the
base line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The porch roof is half of a small box glued over
the doorway. The porch itself is the half of a box
glued below the doorway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, put the finishing touch to the building by
adding a flat roof. Take the cover of your shoe-box.
Cut off all its rims except at one end, a third of the
way around. This end is the roof. Cut it off with
rims and fit it down over the building. Paste it in
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The floors of the apartment are made by pasting
the rest of the cover into the inside of the box, horizontally.
Cut the remaining part of the cover in
half. Fit each section into the box where the floors
should be. Glue the edges that are fitted into the
box. Let them dry thoroughly. Then, you may
furnish the interior with boxcraft furniture such as
is used in arranging Hotel Bandbox.</p>

<p class='c007'>Penny dolls and Noah’s Ark ladies will surely take
up light housekeeping there, if their husbands approve.
In the picture, you will see the janitor, Mr.
Jinks. The Noah’s Ark ladies have come to look at
the rooms.</p>

  <h2 id='RESIDENCE' class='c005'>A BOXVILLE RESIDENCE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Boxville Residence</b>:
a deep, square letter-paper box with its cover,
the cover of a flat letter-paper box about ten inches
long, the cover of a drawer-like pill-box, some glacine
or waxed paper, some artificial flowers, lace-paper
cut from candy boxes, and some box rims.</p>
<p class='c006'>See what a darling little house I have made for a
Boxville Residence! The husband of Mrs. Doll,
who owns the house, goes in his motor car to Boxville
Station every morning. He commutes to Boxtown.
You can see Mrs. Doll and her sister in the picture.
Mr. Doll has gone to Boxtown, but in the picture
of the garage that goes with the Boxville Residence
you will see Mr. Doll’s motor and the chauffeur.
Don’t you think it would be fun to make a Boxville
Residence like mine? I will tell you how to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, of course, you will have to hunt for a deep,
square letter-paper box, and the other materials that
are needed to use in building. When you have found
your box, turn it over so that it stands upside-down.
Take off the cover. That will be the roof, but you are
not ready yet to put the roof on to the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon two opposite sides of the box, mark off two
window spaces. (For windows, see
<a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One <i>AA</i></a>, page 166.)
Each window space measured off, with
help of ruler and pencil, must be an inch and a half
square. Have the bases of the windows, as well as
their tops, made a uniform distance from the base
of the box building. Each window should be an
equal distance from the corner of the box nearest it.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the two sides of the box are marked out with
window spaces, you can begin upon the front of the
house. Draw a door space about four inches high
and two inches broad, and let it come an inch from
the right-hand side of the box building that faces
you. (For front door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two <i>C</i></a>, page
167.) Let the base of your door space come on the
very outer rim of the front of the box. When you
have outlined the door, draw a square in its upper
part to indicate where the plate-glass window is to
be in the door. Cut the top line of your door and
down its right side. Then cut out the square you
made for the window in it. There, the door will
open and close, you see, when you bend it on the side
where the hinge should be! Waxed paper pasted
in a square under the window opening will make
the glass window. Lace-paper makes curtains. A
round-headed paper-fastener with its prongs pushed
through the cardboard door and bent to one side will
make a door-knob with a latch. By turning the knob
you can open or fasten the front door tight.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the door is finished, draw a window space
half-way between the door and the corner of the
building on the front of the house. Now, you can
begin to cut out all the windows. Cut each one
evenly, and paste a square of waxed paper or glacine
paper back of each, inside the box, to make window-glass.
You can outline the window-frames on the
outside, using black ink or paint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doesn’t the box begin to look like a real house?
Yes! But it has no roof yet! Where is the cover of
your box? Slip it down over the building. There
you are! The cover of a small drawer-like pill-box
will make a fine chimney. Glue it on end to the top
of the roof at the center.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where is the flat letter-box cover? That is to be
the porch. Place it on the floor or table, and then
brush the rims of the box that is your Boxville Residence
with paste or glue so that it will stand well
back upon this veranda. Be careful not to have any
paste under the door. See, there is the front porch.
The veranda railing is just a box rim cut from a box
and pasted to the edge of the veranda on the cover
of the letter-paper box.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to have a step up to the front porch, a
small box or its cover will make this.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Boxville Residence has a garden. Mrs. Doll
is very fond of gardens, and so is Mr. Doll also. I
made the garden from a wreath of flowers that was
on an old summer hat. I made an arbor. It was easy
to make that. The arbor is cut from a candy box.
It is just half the rim. I stood it up on its ends and
trimmed it with the flowers. Of course, if you play
out-of-doors with your Boxville Residence, you can
have real flowers to play with. You can lay out walks
with pebbles and gravel when you do not play in the
house. I made a fountain or a pool for the garden
from a hand-glass. At almost any penny store you
can buy a little round mirror that will make a garden
pool. You can make a sun-dial also. It is a spool
with a pill-box placed over one end of it. You will
have to mark off the face of the sun-dial with pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t you think that this makes a comfortable home
for a Boxville resident? I do. I almost wish I were
a little doll, so that I might open the front door and
begin furnishing the inside of the house with box
furniture and spools.</p>

  <h2 id='GARAGE' class='c005'>THE BOXVILLE GARAGE OR STABLE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Boxville Garage
or Stable</b>: one deep letter-paper box with its cover.</p>
<p class='c006'>Here is a toy garage. It belongs to the residence
of Mr. Doll of Boxville. Would you like to make
a garage like it?</p>

<p class='c007'>The box you will need to use for making a garage
must be deep and square. Place it upon the table
standing upon its rims. Then, the bottom of the box
will become the top of your building, and you may
place the cover over this and glue it to make a flat
roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the front of your box, draw a large square
four inches in size. Let the base of this square come
upon the outer rim of the box. The square is to be
the large double door of the garage. (To cut the
door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>B</i></a>, page 167.) Cut the top
line. Cut the base line. From top to base line cut
another line dividing the doorway into halves to form
the doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doors will fold outward when you have
finished cutting them. Paint them green, if you wish.</p>

<p class='c007'>On each side of your box, you may draw a window with blinds. The
window should be two inches square, and should be placed in the
center of each side. Draw a line vertically from top to base of
the window space to make the divisions for the blinds. This line
should divide the window space evenly into halves. (To cut window
with blinds, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>C</i></a>,
page 166.) Cut across the top of each window you have marked out.
Cut down its center line, and cut its base line. Press the
cardboard outward against the sides of the little building to
make blinds. Color the blinds to match the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>There! The garage is finished. Wind up your

  <h2 id='GARDEN' class='c005'>MAKING A BOXVILLE GARDEN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Greenhouse</b>: the
half of some deep box from five to seven inches long
and about five inches deep (the half of a box such as
is usually to be found at a hardware store), about
twelve square inches of cardboard from which to cut
a roof, and a sheet of waxed sandwich paper.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Pergola</b>: half of a
ordinary white shoe-box, and a strip of cardboard
about thirteen inches long and seven inches wide.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make the Garden Itself</b>:
artificial flowers, some spools for flower-stands, sand
paper for roadway and gravel walks, a penny mirror
for a sunken-garden pool, boxes for benches, green
crape paper for grass, a long box to make a hedge,
moss, pebbles, shells, and pretty twigs from out-of-doors.</p>
<p class='c006'>It is such fun to play in a garden that I made one
for Boxville. It belongs to Mr. Penny Doll’s residence.
It has a pergola and a greenhouse, a sunken
pool, flower-stands, gravel walks, benches, and everything
that a garden <i>should</i> have.</p>

<p class='c007'>Green crape paper placed upon the floor will make
the garden lawn. Sandpaper cut in strips and laid
upon it forms the garden paths. A roadway may be
made from sandpaper too. If you have none, ordinary
brown paper will answer. A long box covered over
with green crape paper looks just like a garden hedge.
The paper should be pasted over the sides of the box
quite flat. Garden stands are made by gilding spools
and then poking into each spool, as it stands upright,
some artificial flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Greenhouse for the garden is made from the deep
half of some box about seven inches long and five
inches deep. If you like, your greenhouse may be
made smaller, but this size is an easy one to handle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The box itself forms the greenhouse building. Its
roof is of bent cardboard, and the glass in it is waxed
sandwich paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shall I tell you how to make the greenhouse so that
you may make one like it? First, take the half of
the box you intend to use and place it upon its rims,
open at base.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, one inch above the base, on each corner make
a pencil dot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut the top off the rims of your box.</p>

<p class='c007'>On each <i>end</i> rim, at center, make a pencil dot to
indicate the middle top of each box end. (Leave
sides without marks.)</p>

<p class='c007'>From the center top point on each end cut down
diagonally to right and left, to form the peaked part
of the building under the roof. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Three, <i>CC</i></a>, page 170.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, cut the long sides of the box to meet these,
lengthwise. Remove the cardboard at the top of
each long side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, in the point at one end of the lower half of
the greenhouse building, cut out windows. Cut them
to fit your box building. (See <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One</a>, <i>A</i>,
page 166, for windows.) Back of each, paste some
transparent waxed sandwich paper. If you like,
cut a triangular window in the point of the building
which is to be under the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the lower two windows, cut a door to fit—one inch wide
and two inches high should be a good size. (For cutting a door,
see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.)</p>

<p class='c007'>You may make the roof two inches longer and four
inches wider than the size of the base of your box.
Cut this roof from your cardboard. Fold it through
the center of its long sides to make a gable roof. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Three, <i>C</i></a>, page 170.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In each side of this roof, cut out windows. Paste
back of their openings some waxed sandwich paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Glue the roof to the lower half of the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any small boxes that you have will form flower-boxes
when filled with small artificial flowers. They
may go into the greenhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the pergola, you will need the lower half
of a white shoe-box. Take the box and stand it upon
its rims, base at top, opening below.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut out the cardboard that was the bottom of the
box, leaving a narrow rim around this between corners
on the side that was this box bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, cut off each end of the box, leaving the

<p class='c007'>Cut five inch-wide strips of cardboard two inches
longer than the width of your box, and glue each
across the opening made by cutting the top from the
pergola box. Each strip should be evenly crossed
between opposite pillars.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have any pretty artificial flowers left from

  <h2 id='YACHT' class='c005'>BOXVILLE BOAT-HOUSE OR YACHT CLUB</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Boxville Boat-house</b>:
the lower half of a deep box about six inches
long, and also two shoe-box covers.</p>
<p class='c006'>Boxville Boat-house is made from an oblong box
about two-thirds the size of a shoe-box. Its wharf is
a shoe-box cover, and its roof is another shoe-box
cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to cut a lake from a sheet of silver
paper, the boat-house or yacht club is the very thing
for this play. Any water toys, such as swans, ducks,
fish, or frogs, may swim on Silver Paper Lake, and
from your yacht club, parties of fishermen may angle
for magnetized fish. The boat-house may be a part
of the summer attractions of Hotel Bandbox in season.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make a boat-house building, you will first need
to turn your box over upon its rims so that its bottom
becomes its top.</p>

<p class='c007'>Draw a three-inch square on one short end of your
box. Let its base come to the extreme edge of the
box rim. This square is to be the door you see in
the picture. Draw a vertical line down the center
of this square. This gives two doors for the doorway.
(To cut double door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>B</i></a>, page
167.) Cut across the top line and down the center to
the outer rim. Bend outward the two halves of the
doorway.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boat-house is to have windows, and each window
is to have an awning over it. To make windows
with awnings, first draw on each long side of your
box, two one-inch squares. Each square should be
drawn about an inch and a half from a corner of the
box. Each square should be half-way between top
and bottom of the building. (For windows with awnings,
see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>C</i></a>, page 166.) Cut down both
side lines and across the base line. Bend the cut cardboard
outward and upward to form an awning. Color
this awning with red stripes, using your crayons or
water-color paints.</p>

<p class='c007'>When all windows are cut, then you may place
your little building at the rear of the shoe-box cover
which forms the wharf.</p>

<p class='c007'>Over the top of your building, fit another shoe-box
cover to form a projecting roof over the wharf.</p>

<p class='c007'>A long pencil will be a fine flagstaff. Run its
point through the front of the boat-house roof, and
glue to the top of the pencil a triangular piece of
colored paper to make the pennant.</p>

  <h2 id='HOUSEBOAT' class='c005'>THE HOUSEBOAT “BOXCRAFT”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Houseboat</b>: the
covers of two large shoe-boxes, and the lower half of
a child’s shoe-box.</p>
<p class='c006'>Here is a jolly houseboat, the very thing to sail on
Silver Paper Lake. Little dolls may spend their
vacation upon it. Would you like to make a houseboat
to play with? It is not difficult.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, take the two shoe-box covers and glue them
top to top. Place them on the floor flat. There is the
lower half of the houseboat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon both long sides of your small shoe-box, draw
three one-inch squares, keeping the two at either end
of the same side equally distant from the nearest
corner of the box, and making the third window on
each side half-way between them. (To cut windows
with awnings, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>C</i></a>, page 166.) Cut
the window squares at both sides and along their base
lines. Bend the cardboard outward and upward to
make the awnings. Color these with red stripes,
using either chalks or water-color paints.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the front and rear ends of the houseboat, you
will need a door and window. Make an upright
oblong space for the door. Mark it out with pencil
about three inches high from the rim of the box.
Make a window beside each door. (To cut door
space, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.) Cut top line
and down one side. Bend the door outward on the
third side as if it were on a hinge.</p>

<p class='c007'>A flagstaff for the houseboat is made by pressing
the point of a long pencil down through the top of
the houseboat in front. A paper pennant may be
glued to the side of the pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>A piece of string will make a tow-line for the
houseboat. Fasten it to any little donkey or toy horse
you have, and start penny dolls on a voyage around
the play-room floor. The houseboat, of course, is not
meant to sail upon dangerous water. It might be
safely anchored on the shore of Mirror Lake or Silver
Paper Lake.</p>

  <h2 id='CAMPBOX' class='c005'>CAMP BOX ON MIRROR LAKE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make Camp Box</b>: a yard
or two of green crape paper for grass and foliage of
trees, two or three clothes-pins to make tree-trunks,
a sheet of silver paper or a cheap ten-cent mirror to
form a “lake,” the halves of shallow letter-paper
boxes to make tents, and any pebbles, moss, or shells
you have among your treasures.</p>
<p class='c006'>It is great fun to make a Mirror Lake Camp—almost
as much fun as being in a real camp! Mirror
Lake Camp may be made on the play-room floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, if you have some green crape paper, lay it
flat on the floor. This is the grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, if you have some silver paper, cut out a circle
of it, and paste it to the crape paper to form a lake.
Instead of the silver paper, you may substitute a
cheap mirror. Place this under the crape paper and
cut out a circle above it.</p>

<p><span class='small'>The Boxville Gipsy Cart is made from a correspondence-card box.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You will need a grove of trees near the shore of
your lake. These trees are made by standing some
clothes-pins on end with forks in the air. Cut some
green paper and press it in between the forks. It
makes the foliage of trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tents are made from the half of a shallow white
box like a letter-paper box. To make a tent, cut
through each long side rim of your box as far as the
top or bottom of the cover, as the case may be. Bend
the box downward to each side of this cutting, making
a tent roof, slanting to each side downward. (For
cutting a tent, see <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Three, <i>E</i></a>, page 171.)</p>

<p class='c007'>You may have as many tents in your camp as you
like. Perhaps your tin soldiers might like an encampment
on the shores of Mirror Lake. Small oblong
box covers will make smaller tents for these. When
it is summer, maybe it would be nice, on some warm,
sunny day, to take the tents outdoors under the trees
on the lawn and make a really true camp on the really
true grass, with real growing things for trees in a
woods. Perhaps so!</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut bits of twigs and use these for trees. Pebbles
will help to make a rocky shore for a <i>real</i> water lake
that is a shallow pie-plate filled with water. Its sides
should be covered with moss or short grass. Of
course, after playing out-of-doors with the camp
buildings, you will have to pick them up, when playtime
is over, for the cardboard tents will be spoiled if
you let them stay out over night. I know it because
I tried it! I had a really darling little doll and I let
her stay out in a tent after my play was finished. It
rained in the night and she was all spoiled—and I
had to make a new tent, too. I think you’ll like to
know about this so you won’t try it. It really is better
to pick up after play, I think!</p>

  <h2 id='CART' class='c005'>THE GIPSY CART OF BOXVILLE HIGHWAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Toy Gipsy Cart</b>:
a deep oblong box such as correspondence cards are
packed in, also five square inches of cardboard, four
round-headed paper-fasteners, and two small boxes.</p>
<p class='c006'>Do you think it would be fun to make a gipsy
wagon like the one in the picture? It is a very simple
thing to make.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, find a box such as correspondence cards come
in from the stationery store. Take its high cover off,
and cut from the lower part of the box almost all of
the deep inner rim, leaving only about a half-inch
of it all around. Put the cover back over this, and
glue the two parts of the box together. The box is
to be the gipsy wagon now. A door will need to be
cut at one end of the box, and windows will need to be
made on the sides of the box rim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turn the box over so that its base becomes the top
of your wagon. Make the outline of a door with pencil on one end
of the box. To make it, mark off an upright oblong space an inch
wide and two inches and a half high. Have its base come at the
very edge of box rim. (To cut door, see
<a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.)
Cut one side line from the base of the box up to the top line,
and cut along the top line of the upright figure you have drawn.
Bend the cardboard outward to make a little door. See, it will
open or close as you bend it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, make the windows on the sides of the cart.
You may make these with or without shutters. If
you make them without shutters, you will only need
to cut two one-inch squares in each side of your box.
Each should be evenly distant from a corner. (To cut
plain windows, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.)</p>

<p class='c007'>If, however, you wish to have shutters on the
windows of your wagon, cut these squares at top and
base. Then cut a line through each center, vertically,
from top to base. This gives you the shutters. Press
them back against the outside of the cart. (For
making blinds, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>B</i></a>, page 166.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Window-shutters and door may be painted. Dry
them while you make wheels for the cart. Color
them with water-color paints. Make them green or
red.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wheels are circles cut from stiff cardboard.
Find your compass to help draw them round. If you
have no compass, use the outline of a small round
saucer about two inches and a half in diameter to
guide you in drawing the four wheels in outline.
Draw a hub and spokes on each, if you like.</p>

<p class='c007'>When you have drawn them, cut each out, and
press through the axle of each one a round-headed
paper-fastener. Bend its prongs to either side after
you have pressed the wheel into place on the cart.
The wheels may be glued, if you have no paper-fasteners
to use for making axles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your cart will need a seat for the driver. This is
made from the lower half of a small, narrow box
about two inches in length. Cut off the short end
rims, and glue one long rim to your wagon in front,
so that it makes the dashboard and floor of the front
of the cart under the seat. Paste a small pill-box on
this to make the seat itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the rear of your cart, you may make some steps
by folding a strip of box rim twice and fastening it
under the door with mucilage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shafts for the cart are two narrow strips of cardboard
pasted to the forward part of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c007'>There! The gipsy cart is finished. Penny dolls
or tumble toys will be the gipsies.</p>

  <h2 id='HUT' class='c005'>THE SHEPHERD’S HUT AND THE SHEEPFOLD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making the Shepherd’s
Hut</b>: a yard or two of green crape paper, some corrugated
cardboard, half a small square box about four
inches high, and, if you have it, silver paper to make
a lake.</p>
<p class='c006'>Here in the picture you see the shepherd’s cottage.
I had a little flock of white woolly lambs given me.
They came in a box, with a shepherd boy and his dog
to tend them.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, I decided to build a cottage for the shepherd
and make a sheepfold for his flock. You can
make one for your toy lambs, too, and, if you like, I
will tell you how to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, lay some green crape paper upon the floor
to make grass. There must be grass, you know. Of
course, if you have no green crape paper, you will
need to pretend that the carpet of the floor is grass.
Perhaps it will answer just as well. But, if you have
the paper, you can make a hill or two behind the
place where you intend to build. It is made by putting
some blocks or books under the paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, I made a long fence by cutting some corrugated
cardboard into long strips. Three rows made
the width of this long fence. After you have cut
your fence, stand it upon its rim. By bending the
strip at one end, you can make a gate. The fence is
made of very heavy corrugated cardboard, such as
comes wrapped around very heavy things. There is
a lighter kind that you may also use. From this kind,
I made my sheep-pen. It came wrapped around a
small glass jar.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the sheep-pen, cut a long strip of the
corrugated cardboard. Cut it crosswise instead of
lengthwise, and slip through each undulation in the
cardboard the end of a toothpick. This gives the
effect of a picket fence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shepherd’s but is made from the lower half
of a deep box. Its roof is a piece of corrugated
cardboard cut long and bent through the middle
downward.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the house, turn your box over so that the
bottom becomes the top and the box rests upon its
rims.</p>

<p class='c007'>Measure the size of its ends, and cut two triangular
pieces of cardboard to fit over them and form gables.
Glue each to an end of the house. (For cutting
triangular roof supports, see <a href='#diagram-03-2'>Diagram Three, <i>BB</i></a>,
page 169.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a door and a window in the front of your house.
Both must first be outlined on the box in pencil.
Mark the door an inch wide and two inches high, an
oblong with base at the edge of the box rim. (For
door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.) Cut the top
line and down one long side. Bend the door outward
as if it were on a hinge. One-inch squares may be
cut in the box rim to make windows. (For cutting a
window, see <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One, <i>A</i></a>, page 166.) Cut the
square on all four sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Place a window under the roof in the point of the
gable, if you like.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roof of the cottage is made by measuring, first,
the size of the building you wish to cover. Measure
this on your corrugated cardboard, and add three
inches to its length and breadth. Fold the corrugated
cardboard together to make a pointed roof. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Three, <i>C</i></a>, page 170.) Glue this to the building,
and the little shepherd’s hut is finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>You may make a landscape of mountains behind it,
where the sheep may go to graze. These are blocks
or boxes covered with crape paper. Do not use glue
or paste in doing this. The paper is merely folded
over them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A pretty stream may be made from an irregularly
cut strip of silver paper. The woolly sheep love to
drink at a stream, I am sure. You can see the lake
I made for my landscape. It was a mirror. A rocky
ledge on the mountain-side or by the lake is made
with pretty pebbles such as you may find in the
country.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Box Bridge</b>: a
long cardboard box with cover, a strip of cardboard
about ten inches long.</p>
<p class='c006'>When you look at the picture of Box Bridge, you
will easily see, I think, how it is made. It may be
used in many ways for play. Your toy railway system
may have a bridge as well as a freight station and
tunnel. A box bridge may connect opposite shores
of Silver Paper Lake, and the delivery wagon from
Boxville’s General Store may jog happily over the
bridge to deliver goods at Boxville Cottage. Guests
from Hotel Bandbox may fish from the bridge. I
am sure you will find many other things to play with
it, so I will tell you how to make one, even though
it does seem as if you <i>might</i> almost make one without
directions!</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the box that you wish to use for a bridge.
Remove its cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turn the lower half of the box over so that the
bottom of the box becomes top. Cut a semicircular
piece from each long rim. This makes the long arch
of the bridge. (See <a href='#diagram-04'>Diagram Four, <i>A</i></a>, page 173.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, take the box cover and turn it so that its top
is next to the top of the bridge. The lengthwise rims
of the box will be a railing for the roadway over it.
Cut each end rim at the corner, and let these end rims
be pasted each to a strip of cardboard cut to fit the
width of the box, and join the bridge roadway to the
road along the floor where you are playing. Each
strip of cardboard glued to an end of the bridge may
be about five inches long.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to make more than one bridge, you
may easily do so. The shape of your box, whether
deep or shallow, will make a different kind of bridge.
The landscape of your Boxville may be as full of
silver paper streams and foot-bridges, railway
bridges, covered bridges, toll-bridges, as you please!</p>

  <h2 id='WINDMILL' class='c005'>BUILDING A TOY WINDMILL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Windmill</b>: a
box made with curved sides about five inches deep,
a half-sheet of cardboard, and a long pencil.</p>
<p class='c006'>From any deep box with round sides, you may
make a windmill. You will not need the cover of
the box. Remove it, and turn the lower half of the
box over to stand upon its upper rim so that its top
becomes its base.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a small door about an inch high in the edge
of the lower box rim, just as you see it in the picture
of my box windmill.</p>

<p class='c007'>On its rim, farther up, cut a narrow window. A
half-inch square cut out in the box rim will make this.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roof of the windmill is round and pointed. It
is to be made from cardboard. To make it, take your
compass and draw a circle twice the size of the round
base of your box—or about that. Cut this circle out
of the cardboard, and from it remove a quarter piece
like a large slice cut from a pie.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Three, <i>D</i></a>, page 171.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, lap one edge of your three-quarter circle
over its opposite side. Glue it so. This gives the
round, pointed roof. Paint it, if you wish, with your
paints. Color it bright red or brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sails for windmill need to be cut from a paper
pattern. This pattern must be made from soft paper
that may be folded easily. Pad paper will answer.
Cut a square of pad paper that is half the height of
your windmill. Fold this square together to make
halves—then again to make quarter-sections. Cut in
the folded quarter-section the figure shown for shaping
windmill sails. (See <a href='#diagram-05'>Diagram Five, <i>Z</i></a>, page
174.) Then unfold your paper, and, placing it upon
cardboard, outline all around its edge with pencil.
Then, cut the outline out. This is the sail piece for
your windmill. (For shape of pattern for windmill
sails, see <a href='#diagram-05'>Diagram Five, <i>ZZ</i></a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a hole through its center. Press through it
the point of a long pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make two holes in your box, near the top, below
the roof—one hole exactly opposite the other. Run
the pencil point through these holes. There! The
sails are in place!</p>

  <h2 id='BARN' class='c005'>BOXVILLE BARN AND FARMYARD</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Barn and Farmyard</b>:
the lower half of a large shoe-box and two
shoe-box covers that fit it, a ten-inch square of cardboard,
and the rims cut from a shallow box.</p>
<p class='c006'>Farms are such very interesting places that I am
sure you will enjoy knowing how to make one with
a big barn and a farmyard where your toy animals
may be kept.</p>

<p class='c007'>You may easily make a barn like the one in the
picture. You will need to have a shoe-box to make
the building. Two shoe-box covers make its gabled
roof. Some cardboard is needed from which to cut
supports for the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Begin by turning your box over upon its rim so
that its top becomes the base of the barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one end of the barn, cut a double door. To make
this, first mark a three-inch square upon an end of
your box. Draw a line down its center, vertically.
(For double door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>B</i></a>, page
167.) Cut the top line and down the center line. The base of your
door should be at the edge of the box rim. The two sections cut
in the cardboard make the doors. Press each outward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, you will need to make the two triangular
supports for the box-cover roof. These supports must
be cut from cardboard, and each must be the width
of an end of your box, and be made as high as your
box is wide. (For cutting these supports for a gabled
roof, see <a href='#diagram-03-2'>Diagram Three, <i>BB</i></a>, page 169.) Glue one
to each end of your box, at the upper part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roof is made from your two box covers lapped
one rim under the other, lengthwise, to form a gabled
roof shape. The upper part is glued rim under rim.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-2'>Diagram Three, <i>B</i></a>.) Let the roof dry, and then
slip it over the triangular supports pasted at each end
of the box building to hold the roof in place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a little weather-vane from a strip of cardboard,
if you like, and paste it to the front of the barn roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmyard is made from box rims cut from any
shallow cardboard box you have. The box rims
stand if you cut them with corners. They make a
good enclosure.</p>

<p class='c007'>A small box, placed on end, will make a shed.
The cover of a small box will make a drinking-trough.
Little boxes make chicken-coops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Tumble Toy lives on my farm. You see her

  <h2 id='ANIMALSHOW' class='c005'>BOX BROTHERS’ ANIMAL SHOW</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make an Animal Show</b>:
small boxes of all shapes and sizes, spools, and candy-box
favors, a round bandbox cover to make a circus
ring.</p>
<p class='c006'>The cover of a round bandbox will make a splendid
circus ring. Any small boxes and spools you may
have can be the benches for your trained animals to
perform upon. A really good circus may be made
with Noah’s Ark animals, or with the candy-box
favors that come to one at Christmas and other holiday
times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shall I tell you how I made my circus? You can
make one like it.</p>

<p class='c007'>First of all, I collected animals. At a small candy
shop, I found a polar bear, a rhinoceros, a fox, and a
pig. Each came with a loose head, because the
animals were supposed to be filled with candy, but I
glued the heads on tight. I bought these animals
because they were so cheap.</p>

<p class='c007'>They could stand upon spools to make acts for the
circus ring. I painted each spool red, and pasted
over its hole a disk of colored cardboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>From round box covers I made pyramids, and from
square ones I cut benches. (To cut bench for animal
show, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>A</i></a>, page 175.) Cut a leg
at each corner of the box-cover’s rim. Remove the
cardboard from between cuttings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Swartzenheimer and Mulligan were my animal
trainers. Each came to me as a dinner favor. They
were both little figures of toy men that stood upon a
cake of sweet chocolate. You can easily see what a
splendid clown Mulligan made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The animals performed all kinds of tricks. They
could stand upon each other’s backs. I had two or
three tumble toys, besides. They performed splendidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am sure you will have a good time making a
circus. It is ever and ever so much fun, I think.
You can use any animals that you happen to have
among your playthings.</p>

  <h2 id='CIRCUSTENT' class='c005'>CIRCUS TENT AND CIRCUS GROUNDS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Circus Tent</b>: a
round bandbox and a sheet of cardboard.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make Circus Cages</b>: three
or four hardware boxes from three to five inches long.
A booth may be made from half of a flat letter-paper
box. Some cotton mosquito-netting will be the cage
bars.</p>
<p class='c006'>A circus tent is a very easy thing to make. It needs
nothing but a sheet of cardboard and the lower half
of a round bandbox to make it. The lower half of the
bandbox must be turned over to stand upon its rims.
This forms the sides of the circus tent. The roof is
cut from a large circle of cardboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, arrange the box to make sides for the tent.
Then, cut the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the edge of the bandbox rim, cut out a piece of
cardboard the shape of tent canvas looped back to
make an entrance. Draw some folds upon this with
blue pencil. If you prefer, use your water-color
paints instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this is done, glue across the top of your bandbox
some strips of string to form tent ropes. The
roof of the tent, round and pointed, may next be
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take a large sheet of cardboard and draw upon it
a circle that is half again as large around as the base
of your bandbox. Cut this out. Cut from the circle
a quarter piece like the slice of a pie.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Three, <i>D</i></a>, page 171.) Lap the
cut sides of this three-quarter circle, and glue together to make
a pointed roof like that of a circus tent. When the roof is dry,
slip it upon the top of the hat-box, and your circus tent is done.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you find some corrugated cardboard, it may be
slightly curled and pressed so that it will stand on its
rim, to make a board fence for the circus enclosure.
<i>Of course</i>, you must have a fence! Of course!</p>

<p class='c007'>Hardware boxes that come with covers double and
close telescope fashion make very good circus cages.
To make these cages, you will need to cut top and
bottom from the boxes, leaving rims only. You may,
if you wish, keep a very narrow margin of rim around
the top and bottom cutting of your box. Paste strips of coarse
netting, like cotton mosquito netting, over each opening of the
box. It should be glued inside the box from side to side. This
makes bars for the cages. (For cutting a box to make a cage, see
<a href='#diagram-08'>Diagram Eight</a>, page 182.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Wheels may be added to the cages, so that the
animals may go out on parade. The wheels are
small circles cut from cardboard. There should be
four for each cage, of course. When they are cut out
from the cardboard, fasten each through its center
to the base of a cage by a round-headed paper-fastener.
The prongs of the paper-fastener should be
bent to right and left inside the covers of the box.
This holds wheels firm. If you have no paper-fasteners,
sew the wheels to your box with raffia, or glue
them to your box.</p>

<p class='c007'>A booth for the circus grounds may be made from
a box about three or four inches in size. Stand the
box on its long side. Cut in its back an awning. The
awning is made first by drawing an oblong space upon
the back of the box, cutting this outline down at each
side line and across its base. The cardboard is then
pressed outward and upward to make the awning.
(See <a href='#diagram-01'>Diagram One</a>, <i>C</i>, page 166, for cutting awning.)
Color the awning with red stripes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Side-show tents for circus grounds are made like
the tents of Camp Box. (See <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Three, <i>E</i></a>,
page 171, for cutting the rim of a shallow box and
bending it to make a tent.)</p>

<p class='c007'>All toy figures that you can muster—tumble toys,
wooden dolls, penny dolls, Noah’s Ark ladies, shepherds
and shepherdesses, should go to Box Brothers’
Circus on the play-room floor. If you look among
your toys, you will find animals for the circus, I
know. They may even be animals cut from old
magazine pictures.</p>

<p class='c006'>A zoo is really a splendid thing to make. You can
cage all your wild animals—Noah’s Ark animals,
or whatever other ones you may happen to have. The
cotton animals that are bought in Japanese stores,
“three for five,” are just right for zoo animals. You

<p class='c007'>When you start to build your zoo, the cages will
be made from boxes. Cut out a large square from
each side of the rim. Toothpicks make bars for cages.
They will need to be pressed down: through the top
of the box over openings you cut in the box rims. If
you have no toothpicks, you may make bars for the
cages by pasting very narrow strips of paper or cardboard
inside the box cages over the openings in the
box rims. (For cutting a zoo cage, see <a href='#diagram-08'>Diagram Eight</a>, page 182.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Dens for animals are boxes that have their covers

<p class='c007'>Turn your box over so that it rests inverted upon

  <h2 id='FORT' class='c005'>FORT BOX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Box Fort</b>: a deep,
square box with its cover. A round hair-pin box and
a spool will make a cannon for the fort.</p>
<p class='c006'>Would you like to make a fort for your leaden
soldiers? Shall I tell you how to do it? If your
soldiers are small, a box three inches deep may answer
for the building. Its cover forms ramparts of the
fort.</p>

<p class='c007'>To start the building of your fort, turn your box
over upon its rims so that its base becomes the top
of the building. Take the box cover off and lay it
aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Find a pencil and mark the openings for guns.
They are made like windows upon the box front.
Draw each about a half-inch square, and use your
ruler to make each opening even. Cut these squares
out, if you wish. They may also be painted black,
should you prefer not to cut them out.</p>

<p class='c007'>To add ramparts to the building, take the cover
of your box and make a pencil mark upon its rim
every half-inch all the way around. Cut sections
from the rim, as marked, every other half-inch. Turn
the box with its rim upward and glue it to the top
of your box. (For making ramparts, see <a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Three</a>, page 172.)</p>

<p class='c007'>At the back of the fort, you may easily devise a
sallyport by cutting the cardboard door shaped. (For
cutting a door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A toy cannon may be made with a small round
hair-pint box by pasting it upon the side of a spool
between the wheels of the spool. A thumb-tack
pressed beneath one wheel of the cannon will keep it
upright and prevent rolling. I painted my guns
black. If you like, you may easily do this with water-color
paints.</p>

<p class='c007'>An encampment of tents may be made from small
white box covers cut through each long side rim up
to the top of the cover and bent, to each side of the
center downward. (See <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Three, <i>E</i></a>, page
171, for making a tent.)</p>

<p class='c007'>If you happen to have a penny flag, it will be just
the very thing to wave over Fort Box.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can arrange your fort upon a sheet of crape
paper and make streams and woods all about it. The
streams will be strips of silver paper pasted onto the
green crape paper. The woods will be bits of twigs
pressed into the holes of spools so that the trees stand
upright. Bushes are just bits of twigs that may be
laid down flat. Rocks and mountains may be made
from stones.</p>

  <h2 id='CASTLE' class='c005'>HOW TO BUILD A TOY CASTLE AND A FAIRYLAND HOUSE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Castle</b>: any box,
either round or square—one at least six or seven
inches deep is best.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Fairyland House</b>:
an oblong box deep enough for door and windows
to be cut in its sides, a few little crackers or “goodies”—possibly
some gilt or silver paper in place of these.</p>
<p class='c006'>Have you ever played in fairyland? Well, if you
have not been there, you can very well make a fairyland
upon the play-room floor, and in it you may
gather together all the people of your Red, and Blue,
and Green, and Yellow Fairy Books. These people
will be Knights, and Princesses, Witches, Goblins,
Fairies. All are toys, and it is an easy matter to get
them together—quite as easy as it is to make a fairyland
castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will tell you how. First, you may like to build
the castle, for that is all-important. There never yet
was a fairyland without <i>that</i>!</p>

<p class='c007'>Find some deep box with its cover. It really matters
little whether the box is round or square-sided.
A round box will make a high tower-like castle
similar to the one in the picture. A square one will
make one more like a fortress. It scarcely matters
which you choose. Take the cover from your box.
This is to form the castle ramparts later. High up
in the box rim cut one or two long tower windows.
Cut a door at the base of the rim. Next cut the ramparts
in the box cover. (For cutting ramparts, see
<a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Three, <i>F</i></a>, page 172.) Glue these to the top
of your castle box—and the castle is made!</p>

<p class='c007'>The Princess who lives in the Castle is a penny doll
dressed in a silver robe (made of tinfoil). My Princess
has golden hair. It is long and beautiful. You
can see it in the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Knight is a leaden soldier. His spear is a bit
of wire. His shield is a brass button, polished and
shining.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can easily find the proper kind of dragon at
a little Japanese shop. Mine was made of crockery
and cost ten cents, but you will surely find among the
cotton animals that are sold three for five cents something
far better than my crockery dragon. There are
the most dragon-like of cotton animals at the Japanese
stores where I buy penny toys. Sometimes they
are spidery and sometimes they are like crocodiles—only
they aren’t crocodiles but DRAGONS. When
you go to a Japanese shop and look for penny animals
you will know exactly what I mean. They are all
queer, and will work into any fanciful fairy tale that
you wish to play with your castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t forget to make the dragon a lair, when you
have bought him. It may be just a box with a hole
in it for the mouth of a den, but if you have some
pretty stones and pebbles, you can build a <i>real</i> lair
on the play-room floor with these.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost any fairy tale may be acted out with the
Knight and the Princess. Little toys which you have
among your playthings may help out. I know you
will have a good time playing at fairyland. I did.</p>

<p class='c007'>I built me a Hansel and Gretel house, too. This
was to help with my fairyland play.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hansel and Gretel were two tumble toys—a boy
and a girl. Their home was in a Boxville Cottage.
When they went to the woods and found the Witch’s
House, I made that. It was in a forest of clothes-pins
like the trees made for Camp Box.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made the fairyland house of the Witch from a
deep oblong box. I cut two windows in one rim and
a door between them, as you see it in the picture of the
fairyland house.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the sides of the house, I pasted some little
crackers and goodies. The roof of the house was of
crackers. It was very fairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>I used some pretzels for a fence around it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were some small celluloid dolls among my
playthings, and I made fairies of them. You can see
one that is a Daisy. Her dress is an artificial flower
off my old hat. I took the center out of the daisy
and made a skirt of the petals. The fairy’s wings
were cut from white tissue-paper. They were glued
to the back of her body.</p>

<p class='c007'>All kinds of Halloween figures that are little
favors will answer splendidly for this fairy boxcraft
play. You can easily find dwarfs, gnomes, goblins,
witches, elves. Oh, it will be fun, I know!</p>

  <h2 id='BLOCKS' class='c005'>BOXES USED AS BLOCKS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Block Building</b>: an assortment
of boxes varied in size and shape.</p>
<p class='c006'>Building with blocks is always fun, as you know.
You have tried it with cubes, and with dominoes, and
with cards—but did you ever try to build with boxes
in the same way?</p>

<p class='c007'>The boxes do not need to be glued. Their covers
may or may not be used. Small boxes make walls,
and box covers form roofs. You will see a tall block
building in the picture. It was made from small
drug-store boxes. There is really no end to the ways
in which you may build with these.</p>

<p class='c007'>From boxes of uneven size, men and animals may
be made. Round boxes or small oblong boxes form
heads. Larger boxes make bodies. Legs and arms
are boxes of equal size.</p>

<p class='c007'>The faces are drawn with pencil upon the back
of boxes where there is no print. A wire hair-pin
will keep the arms in place. It will need to be
pressed through the box sides and bent so that the
arm boxes may be slipped upon it. Men of all sorts
may be made. There is great variety, as forms vary
with the shape and size of boxes that you use.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you are playing with some other child, you will
find that it is amusing to divide your store of boxes,
each choosing one at a time till the supply is exhausted.
Then, you may each see how many different
things you can build. It will be a game, and the
winner will be the one who can make the most with
his store.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is entertaining to play with box animals and box
men when you have to spend a day in bed. They
may be placed upon a table near the bedside. They
are light to handle, and they require no cutting or
pasting to muss you up. If you decide to have measles
or mumps, the little boxes may be disposed of easily
after you have played with them. You can always
find new ones to take their place when you are well
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>You may make a puzzle for yourself out of a large
box and a number of smaller boxes of varied size.
Try to pack as many boxes as you can into the large
box. Make them come as evenly as you can in packing.
There will be <i>some</i> space at sides, but with care
and thought you will be surprised to see how small
a space they may be packed into. Try them in various
forms, till you are sure you have reached the best way
to arrange them. Then, give the box puzzle to some
friend to see if he can do with one or two attempts
what you have accomplished. When you give some
person this puzzle, mix your boxes well so there is
no clue to their proper arrangement inside the larger
box.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toys like trains may be built with little more than
a long cracker box for a coach and some oblong box
for engine. The engine’s smoke-stack is a round box.
Its coal-car is a cover taken from a candy box. Its
wheels are buttons or button molds placed on the
ends of wire hair-pins that have been pressed through
the sides of the cardboard boxes. A bit of wax or
plasticine will keep the wheels in place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paste boxes to the back of your cut-outs when you
buy these sheets at the penny store. The Indians,
cowboys, soldiers, and animals will then stand erect
by themselves.</p>

finding new ways to use your boxes in this kind of
play. It is always new, for you may always find
different kinds of boxes to adapt to the building. And
the nice thing about it is that you can make almost
anything you choose.</p>

  <h2 id='NOAHSARK' class='c005'>MAKING A NOAH’S ARK FOR CRACKER ANIMALS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Noah’s Ark</b>:
a child’s shoe-box without a cover, the cover of a large
shoe-box, and some shallow box with cover about ten
inches by four.</p>
<p class='c006'>Next time that you have cracker animals to play
with, build them an ark! It is splendid fun. I will
tell you how to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Find the materials needed to build with—a shoe-box
cover, the lower half of a child’s shoe-box, and
the whole of some very shallow box about ten inches
long and at least four inches wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the base of the Noah’s ark, use the large
shoe-box cover. Cut its rims off. Cut each end
pointed. The ark building is placed on this.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ark building is made from the small shoe-box.
Place it upon its rims so that its bottom becomes top.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a door in one end of the box on the edge of the
box rim. To make this, cut up from the edge of the
rim two inches near the center of the box end. Then
cut horizontally across the box two inches more.
(To cut door, see <a href='#diagram-02'>Diagram Two, <i>A</i></a>, page 167.) After
cutting, bend the door as if it were on a hinge. A
round-headed paper-fastener will make a door-knob
and latch. Press the points of the fastener through
the cardboard door and bend the prongs, or points,
to one side together. In this way, animals may be
securely locked into the ark.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut two triangular supports for the roof of the
ark. They should be cut in heavy cardboard and
made equal-sided. The width of one end of your
box will give you the dimensions to make these. (See
<a href='#diagram-03-2'>Diagram Three, <i>BB</i></a>, page 169.) Paste one of these
cardboard pieces to each end of the ark building near
the top part of the box. Let both dry well before
attempting to put a roof upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roof is made of the two parts of the shallow box. Lap the
long rim of one part over the long rim of the other. Glue the two
rims together, one over the other. (For making a gable roof from
two box covers or from the halves of a shallow box, see
<a href='#diagram-03-2'>Diagram Three</a>, page 169.) When the glue is dry, slip
the roof over the gabled points of the ark building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, when the rains descend and floods come and
there is a RAINY DAY ahead of you, just summon
the cracker animals from the pantry. Arrange them
in pairs. Find a doll for Mr. Noah and a piece of
paper to make the dove. A footstool will be Mount
Ararat, and the ark may voyage all the whole day
upon the play-room floor. When the sun comes out,
you will have been so busy all day that you will have
quite forgotten about the rain.</p>

  <h2 id='SAVINGSBANK' class='c005'>A BOX SAVINGS-BANK FOR PENNIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Savings-bank</b>: a
box in which correspondence cards have been packed,
a small box with a sliding cover, and another similar
to it.</p>
<p class='c006'>When I began to make boxcraft toys, I used to save
my pennies to buy pinwheel paper, cotton animals,
and little figures to use in Boxville. Then, when I
found that I should need crape paper or silver paper,
or a mirror for a pool, I had money to buy it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps you would like to know how to make a
Savings-bank for pennies too?</p>

<p class='c007'>You will need some small box like that in which
correspondence cards come packed at stationery
stores. It has a double cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turn the box over so that the printing on its top
is hidden. Make the top of your box the bottom by
turning it over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Draw two windows and a door on one side of the
box. Paint them, if you like.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paste over the door a porch roof made from half
of one small box. The floor Of the porch is pasted
under it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remove the drawer from the little box with sliding
cover. The outside of the box, as you may have
noticed, is like a tall chimney.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take this and stand it on end at the top of your box.
Draw its outline with pencil on the cardboard. Then
remove the box and cut out the outline just inside the
lines you made.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this is done, you must glue the chimney over
the open hole. Glue it tight and let it dry well. The
pennies, dimes, and nickels may be dropped down this
chimney into the bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one rule which governs this savings account
in my bank—five cents must <i>always</i> stay in the
bank to be “a nest egg.” I made this rule myself.</p>

half of any oblong cardboard box. A few square
inches of cardboard will be required, from which to
cut cardboard disks for the wheels of the cart.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Sleigh</b>: one oblong
cardboard box with its cover. A sled may be
made from the cover or lower half of any long box.</p>
<p class='c006'>If you wish to make a toy wagon, find the half of
some cardboard box. Turn this upward if it is the
cover. Keep the lower half, if you use that, as it is,
upright, open at the top. This is the body of the
wagon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take your compass and with it draw on some cardboard
four circles of the same size. These are the
four wagon wheels. Cut each out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Find two small sticks in the garden. They must
each be a trifle longer than the width of your box.
Press each through the end of the box where wheels
should come—press clear through both opposite rims
of your box. Then press a wheel upon each end of a
stick, and put a bit of wax or some glue where the
linchpin should come. Let the glue dry thoroughly
before you attempt to play with your toy.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strip of cardboard cut to fit the width of the cart
and glued across its upper forward rims will make
the driver’s seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shafts are two strips of cardboard pasted to
the forward sides of the cart. Cut each about half the
length of your box.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whoa there! Back up—back! There is your toy
horse in the shafts. He is waiting for you to tie his
string harness. He will be ready then to go on a
trot round the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to make a sled, take the lower half of
a box and turn it over. Its long side rims will become
the runners of the sled. Cut the end rims off the box.
Then, cut off each corner of the side rims of the box,
slanting your corner cuttings in the same direction.
There you have the runners of your sled! (See

<p class='c006'>To make the sleigh, you will need to use the cover
of your box. Turn it so that it opens at top. Cut the

and glue the cover to the runners. A small box will
make two seats for the sleigh. Fit the cover into the

  <h2 id='CRIB' class='c005'>THE CHINA DOLL’S CRIB, GO-CART, AND MAY BASKET</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a China Doll’s Crib</b>:
the lower half of some oblong box, and four small
oblong pill-boxes of equal size to make the legs of
the bed.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Doll’s Go-cart</b>:
the lower half of an oblong box about seven inches
in length, and some cardboard to make wheels.
Wheels may also be made from top and base of a
small round box three inches in diameter.</p>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Doll’s May Basket</b>:
the cover or top of any small box you may have;
also a small strip of cardboard and two round-headed
paper-fasteners.</p>
<p class='c006'>See, here is a china doll’s crib in the picture. You
can see how easy it is to make it. I hardly need to
tell you. Just take the cover or the lower half of the
box you wish to use, and cut off a part of each long
rim—there is the top of the crib with its head and
foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>To each corner below its base glue the end of a
small oblong pill-box. There! Isn’t that an easy
and quick way to make a toy crib for a doll?</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to make a cradle, cut the box in the
same way, and cut a circle once again as wide as the
width of your box. Cut this circle into half, and
each half will be a rocker for the cradle. Glue one
to each end of the box. That is all!</p>

<p class='c007'>To make a doll’s go-cart like the one in the picture,
take the cover or the lower half of any oblong box
similar to a candy box, one-pound size. Cut the rim
from it half-way around, beginning in the center of
one long side. Next, cut from the part that is without
rim the handle of the cart, as you see the box cut
in the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, cut two circles from cardboard to make the
wheels of the go-cart. Each circle must be of equal
size. Make each about three inches in diameter,
unless your box is more than eight inches long. In
this case out your cardboard circles to correspond,
larger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Run a stick or a long pencil through one circle, and
press the point of the stick through a lower corner
of the box through to the other side, where you put
on the other cardboard circle for the other wheel.
Your stick or pencil must be one inch longer than the
width of your box. Place a blob of glue over each
end of the axle and let it dry well, to keep the wheels
on. When you have fitted the end of a little box
into the lower half of the go-cart to make a seat,
all is done. You may use a piece of folded cardboard
to make the seat, if you prefer. I painted the handle
of my go-cart, but it is not at all necessary to do this.
The go-cart is great fun to use when you play house
and go out marketing. Then you can take your doll
baby with you in the go-cart. You can tie the doll
baby into the cart with a piece of string.</p>

<p class='c007'>The basket that you see in the picture is very easy
to construct. You can use it for many different
things, and as long as you have small boxes—or even
large ones—you may make baskets out of them. You
will need some round-headed paper-fasteners or glue
to help make them. (The paper-fasteners are stronger
and better than the glue.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the lower half of a box, or the upper half,
as you like, and cut a strip of cardboard twice again
as long as the width of your box. This is the basket’s
handle. Glue it inside the inner rim on either side
of the box, or, better still, run the prongs of a paper-fastener
through the side of your box and through
the end of the cardboard strip on both sides of the
box. There is the handle—just see what a cunning
basket you have made!</p>

<p class='c007'>In spring, May baskets can be made this way.
Filled with wild flowers, they are very cunning—just
the thing for a May Day gift.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have some pretty shells that you have picked
up at the shore, they may go into a little box basket
and be given to some little sick child, who will love
to handle them and keep them in their basket by his
bedside.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Easter, fill box baskets with moss or green raffia
cut to represent grass. Glue the raffia to the box.
Then ask cook if she will give you some white beans
like those that are baked with pork in a pot. Place
three or four of these in the moss or raffia cuttings,
and you will have made a cute little basket of eggs
to give as an Easter gift. When your water-color
paint-brush is moistened with blue or brown paint,
make tiny specks on the beans and they will look
like wee little birds’ eggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The box baskets make good Christmas-tree decorations,
too. They may be suspended from branches
by colored paper chains, or be tied on with raffia or
tinsel. Each basket may be filled with candies or with
pretty berries you have found out-of-doors, holly or
bright wintergreen.</p>

<p class='c007'>They may be used as place favors for a Valentine
party when filled with red paper hearts.</p>

  <h2 id='KENNEL' class='c005'>A TOY DOG KENNEL FOR A TOY DOG</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Construct a Toy Kennel</b>: a
small box without its cover, the cover of some larger
box that is square, and cardboard.</p>
<p class='c006'>Here is a picture of Fido, my little dog. I made
him a kennel so that he could stay near the doll-house
at night and be a watch-dog. Perhaps your dog would
like one, if he is a play dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you do want to make one, I will tell you how.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the lower half of your box. This is to be the
building. Turn it over and stand it on end upon the
piece of cardboard you have. Draw the shape of this
end. Add to it about four inches in height. Cut this
piece out and cut another like it. Glue one to each
end of your box. Be sure your box is inverted before
you begin. It should rest upon its rim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, cut each end piece glued to the box to a point
at the top. This makes the point of each gable side
under the roof. These are the points that come under
the roof to support it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut an opening under one of these at one end of
the box. It should be shaped like the door of a dog
kennel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where is a large flat box cover? It is to be the
roof. It ought to be about four inches wider than
the width of your first box. (For making the kennel
roof, see <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Three, <i>E</i></a>, page 171.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Fold this cover downward in equal halves to make
a slanting roof, and place it over the points of the
dog kennel that come front and back of the little
building. There is the kennel all finished! Whistle
to Fido! Come here, Fido, to see the nice kennel
made for you. Don’t you think that it would be fun
some day to make a smaller one for the little china
dog?</p>

  <h2 id='WHEELBARROW' class='c005'>HOW TO MAKE A TEDDY BEAR’S WHEELBARROW</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required for Making a Toy Wheelbarrow</b>:
the lower half of a candy box or a similar
shaped box, one round pill-box for the barrow’s
wheel.</p>
<p class='c006'>The Teddy Bear’s wheelbarrow that you see in the
picture was made from half of a candy box; some
strips of cardboard made the legs and wheel supports,
and a round pill-box made the wheel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do you wish to make a wheelbarrow to play with?
Perhaps your Teddy would like one. I will tell you
how to make it, shall I?</p>

<p class='c007'>First, take the lower half of your box and take one
end rim off. Then, from the upper part of the rim
next to this side, cut out the handles of the barrow.
<i>Next</i>, cut out the cardboard half-way around the
lower part of the box between the handles. This is
the frame of the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut two short cardboard strips each a half-inch
wide and each three inches high. These are the rear
legs. Glue them to the toy at either side at the back.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this, cut two strips of cardboard a half-inch
wide and five inches long. Glue these to the forward
part of the wheelbarrow’s frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>When all are well dry, press the point of a pin
through one of these wheel supports, through the
cover of a round pill-box, on through its other side,
through the other strip of cardboard in front. Then,
if you like, you may put a toothpick in place of the
pin, with a small blob of glue at either end, after you
have cut the hub of the wheelbarrow off to make it
a correct size. Let the glue dry well, and then Teddy
may have his toy to play with.</p>

<p class='c007'>My Teddy and I play at gardening with artificial
flowers on the floor. Sometimes, I make flowers from
tissue-paper to use. Can’t you make them, too?</p>

  <h2 id='FURNITURE' class='c005'>OFFICE FURNITURE FOR DOLLS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make the Office Furniture</b>:
the end of the lower half of a shoe-box makes the
desk, a spool with a round box cover makes the desk-stool,
a high round box four inches high makes a
flower-stand, the cover of a box nine inches long
makes a chair.</p>
<p class='c006'>My dolls thought it would be fun to have an office.
I had a little favor that was made like a tiny typewriter,
and a telephone that came as a favor, too.
You can buy these at any caterer’s or at a candy store.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of my dolls was a stenographer. You can see
her in the picture. Her name is Dosia—Miss Dosia.
The other doll is the bell boy or errand boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make a desk for the office, take the half of your
shoe-box. Cut legs in its forward rim, leaving each
corner. From the side rims cut the two rear legs.
(To cut table or flat office desk, see <a href='#diagram-03-4'>Diagram Six, <i>D</i></a>,
page 178.) Paint the desk with India ink and it will
look like the one in the picture. If you prefer, use
paint, but be careful not to use the paint too moist.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spool makes the desk-stool. Paint it to match
the desk, and stand it on end. Over the top, glue a
round pill-box. Paint this also. It makes a very
cunning stool for a doll eight inches in height.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stand is easy to make. The plant on it was a
favor, too. The stand is just a box about five inches
high. It is put on end and painted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chair takes no time at all to cut. Just find
the cover of a box about eight or nine inches long.
Cut the rim off from it half-way around, starting at
the center of one long side. Bend the part that has
no rim left on it upward to make the back of the
chair, and cut the legs from the lower rim of the rest
of the cover as you cut legs for the desk. (To cut
a chair, see <a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177.) It is fun to
have a doll’s office. With it you can play at business.
What is your business going to be? Are you going to
be a lawyer, or the principal of a little doll’s school?
Maybe yours will be a real estate office for Boxville!</p>

  <h2 id='HAMMOCK' class='c005'>HOW TO MAKE A DOLLS’ HAMMOCK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Dolls’ Couch
Hammock</b>: the lower half of any oblong box that
is deep. One seven or eight inches long will make
a hammock for a doll the same length. Larger boxes
may also be used. Some string is needed to make
ropes.</p>
<p class='c006'>The dolls’ couch hammock in the picture is easily
made. Your large dolls as well as the very small ones
may have hammocks. Shall I tell you how to make
one?</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the lower half—that is usually the deeper
half of a box—and turn it so that it opens at top.
From the front rim, cut out a long lengthwise section
of the rim.</p>

<p class='c007'>At each end of the box, run a string through a corner.
Knot the two end strings that come on the ends
of the box. Knot them together or tie them, so that
the hammock may be suspended wherever you wish
to place it.</p>

<p class='c007'>You may make a mattress for the couch by folding
tissue-paper over brown paper cut to fit the shape
of your box. Better still, you may make a real little
mattress from some canvas or cloth. Cut the cloth
a little larger than twice the size of your box. Fold
it and sew it. Then stuff the mattress with bits of
paper torn to shreds. Pillows for the hammock may
be made in the same way, using smaller dimensions.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can hang the hammock under the railing on
the porch, or fasten it to the rungs of a chair when
you play indoors with it. I am sure your dolls will
be delighted to have you make this for them. If you
are a boy, you can make one for your sister. Boys
ought to know how to use needle and thread as well
as girls. Soldiers and sailors know how to sew. (I
know a man who can do embroidery, but, of course,
that is going pretty far.) A boy ought to be able to
sew a mattress, <i>anyhow</i>. It is as easy as making a
marble-bag.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Theater or Punch
Show</b>: a deep, square letter-paper box and its cover,
and some postal cards with colored views.</p>
<p class='c006'>Would you like to make a toy theater or Punch
Show to play with? Shall I tell you how to make
one out of some deep, square box about eight inches
square and eight inches high?</p>

<p class='c007'>First, take the cover off your box and lay it aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, turn your box over so that it rests upon its
four rims and the bottom of the box is made the top.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the upper part of the box, near the top, outline
an oblong about two inches from each corner of
the box. Measure it with your ruler. Its top should
be two inches from the top rim of the box. The
whole should be about five inches wide and three
inches tall. (To guide you in drawing this, refer to
<a href='#diagram-09'>Diagram Nine, <i>A</i></a>, page 183.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut this oblong you have drawn at both sides and
along its top line. Bend the cardboard inward toward
the center of the box. This will make the
“stage.” (See <a href='#diagram-09'>Diagram Nine, <i>A</i></a>, page 183.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Just over the stage, in the upper rim of the box,
cut a two-inch wide opening the same length as you
cut for the length of the stage below. Cut this out
entirely, so that the little dolls you intend to use for
actors may be dropped on black strings through the
opening and made to walk and dance on the stage.
(See <a href='#diagram-09'>Diagram Nine, <i>B</i></a>, page 183.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind the opening over the stage, cut a slit in the
rim of the box long enough to slip through a fancy
postal card. Slip some pretty colored view through
it, and there will be the scenery for your stage. You
may have pictures of interiors as well as views of
out-of-doors and houses. (See <a href='#diagram-09'>Diagram Nine, <i>C</i></a>,
page 183.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, cut a piece of cardboard the right size for a
sign for your theater, and print its name on the cardboard.
Glue the sign over the stage as you see it in
the picture. It will serve to hide the little dolls’
entrance to the stage on their strings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last of all, place the cover of your letter-paper
box, face down, on its rim on the table or floor, and
put the theater or Punch Show well back upon it so
that there is place for an audience of little dolls in
front. (See <a href='#diagram-09'>Diagram Nine, <i>D</i></a>, page 183.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Benches for the audience of little dolls may be cut
from covers of boxes two and three inches long. (For
cutting benches, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>A</i></a>, page 175.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Your actors may be penny dolls, or any jointed
wooden dolls such as you will find in toy row-boats
at the ten-cent store.</p>

<p class='c007'>I used to collect fancy postal-card views of all

  <h2 id='MERRYGOROUND' class='c005'>HOW TO MAKE A TOY MERRY-GO-ROUND</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Toy Merry-go-round</b>:
two round bandbox covers, or the two halves
of some large round box, a sheet of penny cut-out
pictures of horses or animals, and a cardboard mailing-tube
or a hoop-stick.</p>
<p class='c006'>Everyone may own a merry-go-round. It is made
from two large round bandbox covers and a mailing-tube.
You will also need some pictures of animals
or horses to use on the merry-go-round. Four or five
animals are enough to use. A small box will require
less.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut-out pictures of Indians or cowboys may be
used on the merry-go-round. If you cannot have
these, horses cut from cardboard will answer. To
do this, find a clear outline of a horse in some magazine
picture and trace it upon your cardboard. Then,
when it is cut out, you will have a pattern to help
you make the other horses by drawing around its
edge.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the picture, the horses were each a penny cut-out.
They came as race-horses. They exactly fitted
the bandbox merry-go-round that I made.</p>

<p class='c007'>If your cut-outs are upon thin paper, paste them
upon thin cardboard before you start the work of
making the toy itself. Let them dry while you are
making the merry-go-round.</p>

<p class='c007'>To construct this, first take the cardboard mailing-tube
that you have (or the hoop-stick), and run it
down through the center of one bandbox cover as the
bandbox cover stands on its rims like a platform.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut a small hole in the center of your other bandbox
cover, and press this down over the cardboard
mailing-tube, a third of the way down its length, just
as you see it in the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, take your animals mounted on thin cardboard
and cut each out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut narrow half-inch strips of cardboard for the
poles of the animals. Glue them at equal intervals
around the rim of the upper bandbox cover, inside.
To their bases, glue the animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>When you turn the top of the mailing-tube, the
merry-go-round will twirl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paper figures cut from colored magazine pictures
may ride on the merry-go-round. When it is made
in a smaller size, china dolls may ride on it, and
wooden Noah’s Ark animals may be glued to the
cardboard strips to make very lifelike chargers.</p>

  <h2 id='AUTOMOBILE' class='c005'>MAKING A BOXCRAFT AUTOMOBILE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Build a Box Automobile</b>:
a one-pound candy box with cover, a sample candy
box (oblong ten-cent size), one round box three
inches in diameter, about ten inches of cardboard
from which to cut wheels, four round-headed paper-clips
for wheel-hubs, a toothpick and a round cardboard
key-tag for steering gear, two metal buttons for
lamps.</p>
<p class='c006'>It is not difficult to make a box automobile, for
nobody needs knowledge of mechanics to do it. Paste,
scissors, boxes—and a pair of hands to do the work,
these are all that you will need.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lower half of the large oblong box forms the
body of the car. Take the cover of the box off. This
will be used later for the hood, if you care to put
one on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut off each long inner side rim of the box
except for a corner at each end. Leave the inner rim
of both ends on the box untouched. This forms
the windguard in front and the back of the rear
seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paste the cover tight on your small sample candy
box, and paste the box end to one end of the body of
the car you are building. This completes the shape
of the automobile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, take your round box. Remove its cover.
Cut the cover in half. This forms the wheel-guards
for rear wheels. Paste each where the rear guards
should go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut the lower half of the box in half also. These
halves are wheel-guards for front wheels. Paste them
to the forward part of the automobile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut four circles from your cardboard. Use your
compass to outline them in pencil first. Make each
with a diameter of two inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>When these are cut, run the points of a round-headed
paper-fastener through the center of each,
and fasten the pointed prongs of the paper-fastener
to the cardboard of the wheel-guards. This secures
the wheels. If you prefer, you may glue the wheels
to the guards. They should be painted with spokes
and tires.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Boxcraft Automobile made without hood.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A narrow box rim is glued between the wheel-guards
to make the running-board.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two metal buttons are fastened to the front of the
automobile to form the lamps.</p>

<p class='c007'>A toothpick is pressed into the front of the box to
make the rod of the wheel for steering. The wheel
itself is a round cardboard key-tag fitted upon the
other end of the toothpick.</p>

<p class='c007'>The front seat of the automobile is the end corner
of some small box that is fitted crosswise into the
body of the car and glued in place. The rear seat
is an end of a small box fitted in the same manner
into the body of the car behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boxcraft automobiles are the best there are. They
do not cost you a single penny! Repairs are always
very easy to make, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you care to add a hood to the automobile, it may
be made from the cover of your large box. Cut the
front rim of the box cover down, and slant the long
sides of the cover down to the uncut end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paste an upright piece of cardboard about four
inches high behind your rear seat. To its top, glue
the higher end of the box cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two small strips of cardboard may be fitted under
the hood above the front seat to hold the hood up in
front.</p>

<p class='c007'>I painted the automobile that you see in the picture
with India ink. You could scarcely tell that it was
made out of a box when it was finished.</p>

  <h2 id='DOLLHOUSE' class='c005'>HOW TO FURNISH A DOLL-HOUSE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make Furniture for a
Doll-house</b>: cardboard boxes of all kinds, especially
flat letter-paper boxes, jeweler’s boxes, correspondence-card
boxes. Pencils and spools may be of help
in making some of the furniture.</p>
<p class='c006'>When you look at the pictures of my boxcraft doll-house,
you will see how well it was furnished. All
the chairs and tables, and the bed—all the things that
are in the pictures—are cut from cardboard boxes.
You have just such boxes as I used, I am sure. Every
home has them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shall I tell you how the furniture is made? First,
I will tell you how I made the bedroom, shall I?</p>

<p class='c007'>The old-fashioned canopy bedstead is made from a
candy box and its cover. The four posts are long
pencils. One pencil is run through each corner of
the lower half of the box and glued tight. Then the
cover is placed upon the upper ends of the pencils to
make a canopy. Lace-paper is pasted around the
rims of the cover. I made tissue-paper sheets and
a lace-paper pillow. You can do that, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made a tall bureau from eight empty match-boxes.
The match-boxes were safety match-boxes
with tiny drawers that are made to slide in and
out. I saved till I had eight boxes. Then, I glued
four, one on top of the other, and four others I glued
in the same way. When these were dry, I pasted my
two sets together. This made the upper part of the
bureau. To make legs, I cut a low bench from a
small box cover and pasted the boxes to its top. (For
bench, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>A</i></a>, page 175.) I sewed shoe-buttons
to each drawer to make a handle. The mirror
is a piece of cardboard cut oblong and pasted at the
back of the bureau so that it is upright. I painted
a frame around the sides of the cardboard to make it
look like a mirror. The bureau cover is a strip of
lace-paper. The candle and candlestick came off
a birthday cake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wash-stand is cut from the lower half of a box
about five inches long. It is cut almost as if it were
a bench, only that its legs are shorter. The “splasher”
is a piece of cardboard pasted upright at the back of
the box.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>Piano and Grandfather’s Clock made from boxes.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Almost all chairs I made were cut from narrow
box covers and jewelers’ hat-pin boxes. One hat-pin
box will make two chairs. Each half makes one.
(For chair, see <a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177.) Hat-pin
boxes will make high-backed chairs. Other box
covers make other kinds. When you cut an ordinary
chair with a low back, begin to cut the rim from the
side of your box near the center on one long side.
When you make a chair from a hat-pin box, cut the
rim off your box two thirds of the way around,
leaving one end only with the rim on. The part
without rim is the back of the chair. Press that upward,
and cut the legs of the chair from the end that
has a rim left upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made a grandfather’s clock by standing a hat-pin
box on end. I glued to its upper front part the face
of a penny watch. You do not need to spend a penny.
Just mark the face of a clock in pencil and glue it to
the front of your clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Really, I am very proud of the piano. It is not
every doll-house that can have a piano—but you can
make one, for it is easy. You will need a shallow
letter-paper box and a narrow box such as fountain
pens come in from the store where they are bought.
Paste one long side of the narrow box across the front
or back of the letter-paper box after you have stood
the letter-paper box upright. The narrow box should
be placed about where you think the keyboard belongs.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Six, <i>F</i></a>, page 179, for making a
piano from two boxes.) The music-rest is a bit of
folded box rim glued to the central part of the piano
above the keyboard. The keyboard is marked off with
ink upon a strip of white paper and pasted upon the
top of the narrow box. You can easily draw the first
part of some music that you know, and place it on a
tiny sheet of white paper to make a “piece” for the
piano’s music-rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mantel for the living-room may be made from
a flat letter-paper box. Stand the box upon one long
rim and place its printed side to the back. Cut from
the front a mantel opening like the opening for a
fireplace. (See <a href='#diagram-03-5'>Diagram Six, <i>G</i></a>, page 180.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The Morris chair is made like any other chair.
(See <a href='#diagram-03-3'>Diagram Six, <i>C</i></a>, page 177, for cutting a chair
from a box.) It has two bent box rims glued to each
side to make the arm rests, and the cardboard is cut
rounding from the front rim of the box in cutting its
legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made a very cute little cupboard for my doll-house
dining-room. It was easily made. You can
make one out of any shallow box that is like a spool
box, by cutting out all of its front rim excepting a narrow
margin left all the way around its front cover. I
cut some strips of cardboard and fitted them across the
inside of this box and glued them to make shelves.
Lace-paper made the shelf-paper. Metal corks from
bottles and cold-cream tubes made mugs and silver-ware.
Plates for the dining-room were circles cut
from cardboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sideboard may be made from half of a letter-paper
box, cutting this in half lengthwise. Then
cut this half the box as if you were making a high
bench. Do not cut far up in the box rim to make the
legs. Cut them curving at the front. Outline a
drawer and cupboard doors upon the front, and paste
a plate-rack at back. It is the cover of a narrow box
glued behind the buffet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all my doll-house furniture, I like the kitchen
best. It looks so homelike. If I were a little doll,
I know I should love to go into that kitchen and make
candy on the stove. It would be such fun!</p>

<p class='c007'>The stove is made from an oblong candy box cut
like a bench. At two sides of its front, I cut oven
doors and put round-headed paper-fasteners through
them to make knobs. The prongs of each paper-fastener,
bent, make latch for oven doors. At the
back of each oven door, right inside the box, I pasted
a small box and made a real little oven. I could put
dishes in it!</p>

<p class='c007'>The boiler in the kitchen is the kind of round tin
they use to pack blue-print paper in. I stood mine
on a spool after I washed the printed paper off from
it. You can use an old baking-powder tin, if you
have no blue-print paper box.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can see how the kitchen sink is made—merely
a box cover placed over the end of a deeper box. At
the back of the box paste an upright piece of cardboard.
The faucets are made from the two ends of
a kid hair-curler pressed through the cardboard
downward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kitchen table is the lower half of a correspondence-card
box. It is cut as if it were a bench with long legs. (For cutting
the bench, see <a href='#diagram-06-1'>Diagram Six, <i>A</i></a>, page 175.)</p>

<p class='c007'>You will have a very good time playing in your
doll-house, if you make one. You can make a four-roomed
house from four large bandboxes placed on
their sides. Put two upon the floor and glue the
other two to their tops. Of course, you will not need
to use the covers of the boxes. Each bandbox will
make a room.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can use strips of wall-paper for carpets and
rugs. You can cut windows in the bandboxes. When
you have furnished the doll-house, it will be quite
like a real little home.</p>

<p class='c007'>I painted my furniture with ink. If you paint
yours, be careful to put newspapers down under your
work, and be very, very careful to use your brush as
dry as you can. In this way your work will be evenly
colored. Let the furniture dry thoroughly before
you attempt to play with it. If you like, you may
paint it with water-color paints.</p>

long pencils, and about twelve square inches of cardboard.</p>
<p class='c006'>Ringfling is a jolly game. I am sure you will
enjoy playing it. As many children as can play
happily together may play the game. The first rule
of the game is, “The more, the merrier!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It takes but a moment to collect materials with
which to play the game. The game itself may be
made in about ten minutes—or less.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the deep lower half of some large square box
and draw from corner to corner across its top. (See
figure in <a href='#diagram-11'>Diagram Eleven, <i>A</i></a>, page 185.) Do this
with heavy pencil lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>Number each section of the board but one, using

section blank.</p>

like this larger one, and cut it in the very same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take your pencils. Press the point of one into each
section of the game-board at its center near the
numeral you have drawn. Press the points of the
pencils down first, and be careful to keep each hole
small, so that the pencil will not slip too far down
in it. The tops of all pencils should be of an even
height, as you see them in the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here are the rules of the game:</p>

<p class='c015'>Players play in turn.</p>

<p class='c015'>Players count out to see who will begin the
game and who will follow.</p>

<p class='c015'>Each play consists of a turn to throw the large
ring and the small ring.</p>

<p class='c015'>The object of play is to have the ring tossed
fall so that it circles about a pencil.</p>

<p class='c015'>When a ring circles a pencil, it gives the player
the count of the number that is upon that section.
The small circle doubles the count.</p>

<p class='c015'>Twelve counts win the game. The first to
obtain this wins. You may make it eighteen—to
make a longer game.</p>

<p class='c015'>The game is played in rounds. To avoid dispute,
it is best to keep the score of all players
with pencil and paper.</p>

<p class='c015'>Each player must stand five ruler lengths from
the game when he flings the circles.</p>

  <h2 id='CHUTES' class='c005'>THE GAME OF “SHOOT THE CHUTES”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make the Game of “Shoot
the Chutes”</b>: a long box and its cover, and one high
box without a cover—some spools.</p>
<p class='c006'>This little boxcraft game may be played by two
players. It is an easy game to make, as you can see
by looking at the picture. It is made of two parts of
one long box, with the lower half of another that is
higher. It is played with spools.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the game, first cut the lower half of your
long box as you see it cut in the picture. Make two
openings in its rim, each wide enough to let a spool
roll through it. Stand this part of the box upon the
floor as you see it placed in the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, you are ready to make the chutes. Cut the
cover’s rim—the rim of the long box—at each corner,
and press the cardboard out at each end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rest this part of the long box in a slanting position
against your high box.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paint four spools. Make two red and two blue.
Two of the same color belong to each player.</p>

<p class='c007'>The game is to try to get your two spools into the
box. Every time you get a spool in by rolling it down
the chutes, it counts you one count.</p>

<p class='c007'>Players play in turn, one spool at a time. The
game is played in rounds. The first player to reach
the score of seven wins.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make “One-Two-I-Catch-You”</b>:
a square box cover and two buttons, one dark
and one light. The counter is a round pill-box. (A
square pill-box will do as well.)</p>
<p class='c006'>This boxcraft game of “One-Two-I-Catch-You”
is like a game of tag. It is a tag game on a game-board.
As it is not so noisy a game, you can play it
in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the board to play on, take your pencil and
your ruler. Rule a line from corner to corner across
the inside of the box cover. Then, rule a line that
will cross the center of the box, and another that
crosses the center from the other side. This makes
the triangular divisions of the board. Paint the
triangles, alternating, black or blue. Leave the ones
between, white. (See <a href='#diagram-12'>Diagram Twelve</a>, page 186.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Find your buttons now. Two players are to play
this game. You will need a pill-box for a counter.
Glue its cover on tight, and put a number <i>one</i> on its
top and a number <i>two</i> on its base.</p>

<p class='c007'>Play in turn, and toss the counter to see how far you
can move. When the counter falls, take the number
that is on its top and move as many triangles in either
direction as the counter indicates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each player takes a different colored button to
begin the game. Each button is placed in an opposite
corner of the board. Each player must try to catch
the other player by getting onto his triangle. The first
to catch the other player three times is winner.</p>

  <h2 id='MISTERBOX' class='c005'>THE FUNNY GAME OF “MISTER BOX”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make the Funny Game of
“Mister Box”</b>: one large box with a cover—one similar
to a shoe-box—two or three spools.</p>
<p class='c006'>Allow me to introduce to you my friend Mister
Box. He is funny and he is jolly. He likes to catch
spools in his mouth, if you will be so kind as to throw
them in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mister Box is a game. You can make a game like
him. I will tell you how. You will need an empty
box about the size of a shoe-box. It should have a
cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two or three players may play the game. Each
will need an empty spool to play the game with.
Each player may color his spool a different color.
One may be blue; one may be red; and the third,
if there are three players, may be green.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, to make Mister Box. Place your box on
end and glue the cover tight. Next, take your pencil
and draw a big face on the back of the box. Make
the mouth large and round. Cut out the cardboard
inside the mouth to make a big round hole about four
inches wide. You can color Mister Box with your
crayons, if you like. His hair should be brown, and
his eyes too.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, to play the game, every player must stand,
in turn, in the same place on the carpet or floor rug,
four feet from the box. Measure four ruler lengths
to get this. Each must try to get his spool into Mister
Box. Toss the spool. No player may touch his spool
till all have finished playing the round. The first one
to get his spool into Mister Box six times wins.</p>

  <h2 id='MAGICBOX' class='c005'>HOW TO MAKE A MAGIC BOX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><b>Material Required to Make a Magic Box</b>: two
small oblong boxes with covers that slide over an
inner drawer. Both boxes must be about an inch and
a half long. Both must be duplicates of each other.
About two yards of light twine are needed.</p>
<p class='c006'>The magic box is truly a wonderful one. It will
obey every command you give it—yes, it will! There
is a secret that you will have to learn, but when you
know this secret the little box will <i>have</i> to do just as
you bid it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The magic box is on a string. As it descends, you
cry, “Halt!” The box stops at once. “Go on!” you
cry. The box continues down the string. “Faster,
faster!” The box fairly flies in its haste to get down
to the floor! Wonderful! Wonderful!</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, let me tell you how to do it. (It is a trick,
of course!)</p>

<p class='c007'>Find a small stick, round and smooth like a half
of a toothpick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take the sliding cover from one of your boxes, and
fit inside the drawer, across the center of it, the piece
of wood so that there is space under it and above it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, make a small hole at each end of the drawer
of your box, and thread some string through both
holes, letting the string pass <i>under</i> the stick of wood
in the drawer. (See <a href='#diagram-13'>Diagram Thirteen</a>, <i>A</i>, page 187.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Place the sliding cover on the box and let the string
pass through it at both ends. (See <a href='#diagram-13'>Diagram Thirteen</a>,
<i>B</i>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The SECRET of your magic box is the piece of
wood in the drawer. Tell nobody about this. When
you hold one end of the string in your right hand,
place the toe of your shoe on the floor over the other
end and keep the string taut. Then, loosen your hold
slightly, and carefully bring the box upon the string
up as far as your hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>When you loosen the hold upon the string to make
it less tight, you will notice that the box slides rapidly
down the string; when you hold the string absolutely
taut, the box remains firmly in one place. By practising,
you will find just how much to loosen your
hold on the string in order to make the box do as you
wish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anyone who sees the box performing so wonderfully
will not readily guess the secret of its magic.
Here the second box, that is a duplicate of the first,
comes into the play. Arrange this second box as if
it were the trick box—except for the stick through
the drawer. When your friends ask to examine the
magic box, give them the second one. Keep both in
your pocket. In putting the trick box into your
pocket, slide its drawer a little, so that you can easily
distinguish between the two boxes by feeling of them.
When you give the duplicate, nobody will suspect
that it is not the real box, if you manage cleverly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonderful! Wonderful!” they say. “What a MAGIC BOX you have!”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
